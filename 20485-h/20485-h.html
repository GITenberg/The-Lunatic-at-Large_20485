<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Into the history of Mr Francis Beveridge, as supplied
by the obliging candour of the Baron von
Blitzenberg and the notes of Dr Escott, Dr Twiddel
and his friend Robert Welsh make a kind of
explanatory entry. They most effectually set the ball
a-rolling, and so the story starts in a small room looking
out on a very uninteresting London street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was about three o’clock on a November afternoon,
that season of fogs and rains and mud, when towns-people
long for fresh air and hillsides, and country-folk
think wistfully of the warmth and lights of a city, when
nobody is satisfied, and everybody has a cold. Outside
the window of the room there were a few feet of earth
adorned with a low bush or two, a line of railings, a stone-paved
street, and on the other side a long row of uniform
yellow brick houses. The apartment itself was a modest
chamber, containing a minimum of rented furniture and
a flickering gas-stove. By a small caseful of medical
treatises and a conspicuous stethoscope, the least experienced
could see that it was labelled consulting-room.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg6" id="Pg6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr Twiddel was enjoying one of those moments of
repose that occur even in the youngest practitioner’s
existence. For the purposes of this narrative he may briefly
be described as an amiable-looking young man, with a
little bit of fair moustache and still less chin, no practice
to speak of, and a considerable quantity of unpaid bills.
A man of such features and in such circumstances invites
temptation. At the present moment, though his waistcoat
was unbuttoned and his feet rested on the mantelpiece,
his mind seemed not quite at ease. He looked
back upon a number of fortunate events that had not
occurred, and forward to various unpleasant things that
might occur, and then he took a letter from his pocket
and read it abstractedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can’t afford to refuse,”</span> he reflected, lugubriously;
<span class="tei tei-q">“and yet, hang it! I must say I don’t fancy the job.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When metal is molten it can be poured into any vessel;
and at that moment a certain deep receptacle stood on the
very doorstep.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor heard the bell, sat up briskly, stuffed the
letter back into his pocket, and buttoned his waistcoat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A patient at last!”</span> and instantly there arose a
vision of a simple operation, a fabulous fee, and twelve
sickly millionaires an hour ever after. The door opened,
and a loud voice hailed him familiarly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only Welsh,”</span> he sighed, and the vision went the way
of all the others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gentleman who swaggered in and clapped the
doctor on the back, who next threw himself into the
easiest chair and his hat and coat over the table, was in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg7" id="Pg7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fact Mr Robert Welsh. From the moment he entered
he pervaded the room; the stethoscope seemed to grow
less conspicuous, Dr Twiddel’s chin more diminutive,
the apartment itself a mere background to this guest.
Why? It would be hard to say precisely. He was a
black-moustached, full-faced man, with an air of the
most consummate assurance, and a person by some
deemed handsome. Yet somehow or other he inevitably
recalled the uncles of history. Perhaps this assurance
alone gave him his atmosphere. You could have felt
his egotism in the dark.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He talked in a loud voice and with a great air of mastery
over all the contingencies of a life about town. You
felt that here sat one who had seen the world and gave
things their proper proportions, who had learned how
meretricious was orthodoxy, and which bars could really
be recommended. He chaffed, patronised, and cheered
the doctor. Patients had been scarce, had they? Well,
after all, there were many consolations. Did Twiddle
say he was hard up? Welsh himself in an even more
evil case. He narrated various unfortunate transactions
connected with the turf and other pursuits, with regret,
no doubt, and yet with a fine rakish defiance of destiny.
Twiddel’s face cleared, and he began to show something
of the same gallant spirit. He brought out a tall bottle
with a Celtic superscription; Welsh half filled his glass,
poured in some water from a dusty decanter, and proposed
the toast of <span class="tei tei-q">“Luck to the two most deserving sinners in
London!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor was fired, he drew the same letter from his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span><a name="Pg8" id="Pg8" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pocket, and cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“By Jove, Welsh, I’d almost forgotten
to tell you of a lucky offer that came this morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was not strictly true, for as a matter of fact the
doctor had only hesitated to tell of this offer lest he should
be shamed to a decision. But Welsh was infectious.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Congratulations, old man!”</span> said his friend. <span class="tei tei-q">“What’s
it all about?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here’s a letter from an old friend of my
people’s—Dr Watson, by name. He has a very good
country practice, and he offers me this job.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He handed the letter to Welsh, and then added, with a
flutter of caution, <span class="tei tei-q">“I haven’t made up my mind yet.
There are drawbacks, as you’ll see.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh opened the letter and read:—</p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dear Twiddel</span></span>,—I
  am happy to tell you that I am
  at last able to put something in your way. A gentleman
  in this neighbourhood, one of my most esteemed patients,
  has lately suffered from a severe mental and physical
  shock, followed by brain fever, and is still, I regret to
  say, in an extremely unstable mental condition. I have
  strongly recommended quiet and change of scene, and at
  my suggestion he is to be sent abroad under the care of a
  medical attendant. I have now much pleasure in offering
  you the post, if you would care to accept it. You will
  find your patient, Mr Mandell-Essington, an extremely
  agreeable young man when in possession of his proper
  faculties. He has large means and no near relatives;
  he comes of one of the best families in the county; and
  though he has, I surmise, sown his wild oats pretty freely,
  he was considered of unusual promise previous to this
  unfortunate illness. He is of an amiable and pleasant
  disposition, though at present, we fear, inclined to suicidal
  <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg9" id="Pg9" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
  tendencies. I have no particular reason to think he is
  at all homicidal; still, you will see that he naturally requires
  most careful watching. It is possible that you may
  hesitate to leave your practice (which I trust prospers);
  but as the responsibility is considerable, the fee will be
  proportionately generous—£500, and all expenses paid.”</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I would suggest a trip on the Continent. The

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh looked at his friend with the respect that prosperity
naturally excites. He smiled on him as an equal,
and cried, heartily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Congratulations again! When do
you start?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel fidgeted uncomfortably, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—er—well, you
see—ah—I haven’t
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quite</span></span> made up my mind yet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What’s the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hang it, Welsh—er—the fact is I don’t altogether
like the job.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scruples of any kind always surprised Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can’t afford to leave the practice?”</span> he asked with
a laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That’s—ah—partly the reason,”</span> replied Twiddel,
uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rot, old man! There’s a girl in the case. Out
with it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, it isn’t that. You see it’s the very devil of a
responsibility.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg10" id="Pg10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this confession of weakness he looked guiltily at his
heroic friend. From the bottom of his heart he wished
he had screwed up his courage in private. Welsh had so
little imagination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By Gad,”</span> exclaimed Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’d manage a nunnery
for £500!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I daresay you would, but a suicidal, and possibly
homicidal, lunatic isn’t a nunnery.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh looked at his friend with diminished respect.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you are going to chuck up £500 and a free trip
on the Continent?”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dr Watson himself admits the responsibility.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With a—what is it?—agreeable young man?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Only when in possession of his proper faculties,”</span>
said the doctor, dismally.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And an amiable disposition?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With suicidal tendencies, hang it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should have thought,”</span> said Welsh, with a laugh,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that they would only matter to himself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But he is homicidal too—or at least it’s doubtful.
I want to know a little more about that, thank you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is the man’s name?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mandell-Essington.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sounds aristocratic. He might come in useful afterwards,
when he’s cured.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh spoke with an air of reflection, which might have
been entirely disinterested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He’d probably commit suicide first,”</span> said Twiddel,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and of course I’d get all the blame.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Or homicide,”</span> replied Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“When
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span> would.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg11" id="Pg11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, he wouldn’t—that’s the worst of it;
I’d be blamed for having my own throat cut.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Twiddel,”</span> said his friend, deliberately, <span class="tei tei-q">“it seems to
me you’re a fool.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m at least alive,”</span> cried Twiddel, warming with
sympathy for himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“which I probably wouldn’t be for
long in Mr Essington’s company.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t blame your nerves, dear boy,”</span> said Welsh,
with a smile that showed all his teeth, <span class="tei tei-q">“only your head.
Here are £500 going a-begging. There must be some
way&mdash;&mdash;”</span> He paused, deep in reflection. <span class="tei tei-q">“How would
it do,”</span> he remarked in a minute, <span class="tei tei-q">“if
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> were to go in your place?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Couldn’t be managed?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Couldn’t possibly, I’m afraid.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Welsh. <span class="tei tei-q">“I foresee difficulties.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He fished a pipe out of his pocket, filled and lit it, and
leaned back in his chair gazing at the ceiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Twiddel, my boy,”</span> he said at length, <span class="tei tei-q">“will you give
me a percentage of the fee if I think of a safe dodge for
getting the money and preserving your throat?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rather!”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am perfectly serious,”</span> replied Welsh, keenly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’m
certain the thing is quite possible.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He half closed his eyes and ruminated in silence. The
doctor watched him—fascinated, afraid. Somehow or
other he felt that he was already a kind of Guy Fawkes.
There was something so unlawful in Welsh’s expression.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg12" id="Pg12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They sat there without speaking for about ten minutes,
and then all of a sudden Welsh sprang up with a shout of
laughter, slapping first his own leg and then the doctor’s
back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By Gad, I’ve got it!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he had; hence this tale.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a certain fertile and well-wooded county of England
there stands a high stone wall. On a sunny
day the eye of the traveller passing through this
province is gratified by the sparkle of myriads of
broken bottles arranged closely and continuously along its
coping-stone. Above these shining facets the boughs of
tall trees swing in the wind and throw their shadows
across the highway. The wall at last leaves the road and
follows the park round its entire extent. Its height never
varies; the broken bottles glitter perpetually; and only
through two entrances, and that when the gates are open,
can one gain a single glimpse inside: for the gates are
solid, with no chinks for the curious.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The country all round is undulating, and here and
there from the crest of an eminence you can see a great
space of well-timbered park land within this wall; and
in winter, when the leaves are off the trees, you may
spy an imposing red-brick mansion in the midst.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any native will inform you, with a mixture of infectious
awe and becoming pride, that this is no less than the
far-famed private asylum of Clankwood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ideal institution bore the enviable reputation of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg14" id="Pg14" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
containing the best-bred lunatics in England. It was
credibly reported that however well marked their symptoms
and however well developed their delusions, none but
ladies and gentlemen of the most unblemished descent
were permitted to enjoy its seclusion. The dances there
were universally considered the most agreeable functions
in the county. The conversation of many of the inmates
was of the widest range and the most refreshing
originality, and the demeanour of all, even when most
free from the conventional trammels of outside society,
bore evidence of an expensive, and in some cases of a
Christian, upbringing. This is scarcely to be wondered
at, when beneath one roof were assembled the heirs-presumptive
to three dukedoms, two suicidal marquises,
an odd archbishop or so, and the flower of the baronetage
and clergy. As this list only includes a few of the celebrities
able or willing to be introduced to distinguished
visitors, and makes no mention of the uncorroborated
dignities (such as the classical divinities and Old Testament
duplicates), the anxiety shown by some people to
certify their relations can easily be understood.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr Congleton, the proprietor and physician of Clankwood,
was a gentleman singularly well fitted to act as
host on the occasion of asylum reunions. No one could
exceed him in the respect he showed to a coroneted head,
even when cracked; and a bishop under his charge was
always secured, as far as possible, from the least whisper
of heretical conversation. He possessed besides a pleasant
rubicund countenance and an immaculate wardrobe.
He was further fortunate in having in his assistants,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg15" id="Pg15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Dr Escott and Dr Sherlaw, two young gentlemen whose
medical knowledge was almost equal to the affability
of their manners and the excellence of their family connections.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One November night these two were sitting over a
comfortable fire in Sherlaw’s room. Twelve o’clock
struck, Escott finished the remains of something in a
tumbler, rose, and yawned sleepily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Time to turn in, young man,”</span> said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose it is,”</span> replied Sherlaw, a very pleasant
and boyish young gentleman. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo! What’s that?
A cab?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They both listened, and some way off they could just
pick out a sound like wheels upon gravel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s very late for any one to be coming in,”</span> said
Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sound grew clearer and more unmistakably like a
cab rattling quickly up the drive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a cab,”</span> said Sherlaw.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They heard it draw up before the front door, and then
there came a pause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who the deuce can it be?”</span> muttered Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a few minutes there came a knock at the door, and
a servant entered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A new case, sir. Want’s to
see Dr Congleton particular.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A man or a woman?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Man, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right,”</span> growled Sherlaw. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll come, confound
him.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg16" id="Pg16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bad luck, old man,”</span> laughed Escott. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll wait
here in case by any chance you want me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He fell into his chair again, lit a cigarette, and sleepily
turned over the pages of a book. Dr Sherlaw was away
for a little time, and when he returned his cheerful face
wore a somewhat mystified expression.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well?”</span> asked Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rather a rum case,”</span> said his colleague, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What’s the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who was it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t know that either.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Escott opened his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What happened, then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said Sherlaw, drawing his chair up to the fire
again, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll tell you just what did happen,
and you can make what you can out of it. Of course, I suppose
it’s all right, really, but—well, the proceedings were
a little unusual, don’t you know.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I went down to the door, and there I found
a four-wheeler with a man standing beside it. The door of
the cab was shut, and there seemed to be two more men
inside. This chap who’d got out—a youngish man—hailed
me at once as though he’d bought the whole
place.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘You Dr Congleton?’</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Damn your impertinence!’</span>
I said to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">‘ringing people up at this hour, and
talking like a bally drill-sergeant.’</span></span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg17" id="Pg17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I told him politely I wasn’t
old Congers, but that I’d make a good enough substitute
for the likes of him.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘I tell you what it is,’</span> said the
Johnnie, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I’ve brought a patient for Dr Congleton, a
cousin of mine, and I’ve got a doctor here, too. I want
to see Dr Congleton.’</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘He’s probably in bed,’</span> I said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘but I’ll do just as well. I suppose he’s certified,
and all that.’</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Oh, it’s all right,’</span> said the
man, rather as though he expected me to say that it wasn’t.
He looked a little doubtful what to do, and then I heard some one
inside the cab call him. He stuck his head in the window and
they confabbed for a minute, and then he turned to me
and said, with the most magnificent air you ever saw,
like a chap buying a set of diamond studs, <span class="tei tei-q">‘My friend here
is a great personal friend of Dr Congleton, and it’s a
damned&mdash;&mdash; I mean it’s an uncommonly delicate matter.
We must see him.’</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, if you insist, I’ll see
if I can get him,’</span> I said;
<span class="tei tei-q">‘but you’d better come in and wait.’</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So the Johnnie opened the door of the
cab, and there was a great hauling and pushing, my friend pulling
an arm from the outside, and the doctor shoving from within,
and at last they fetched out their patient. He was a
tall man, in a very smart-looking, long, light top-coat,
and a cap with a large peak shoved over his eyes, and he
seemed very unsteady on his pins.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Drunk, by George!’</span> I said to myself
at first.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The doctor—another young-looking
man—hopped out after him, and they each took an arm, lugged
their patient into the waiting-room, and popped him into an armchair.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg18" id="Pg18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
There he collapsed, and sat with his head hanging
down as limp as a sucked orange.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I asked them if anything was the matter
with him.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Only tired,—just a little
sleepy,’</span> said the cousin.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And do you know, Escott, what I’d stake my best
boots was the matter with him?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The man was drugged!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Escott looked at the fire thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it’s quite possible; he might have
been too violent to manage.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why couldn’t they have said so, then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“H’m. Not knowing, can’t say. What happened
next?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Next thing was, I asked the doctor what
name I should give. He answered in a kind of nervous way, <span class="tei tei-q">‘No
name; you needn’t give any name. I know Dr Congleton
personally. Ask him to come, please.’</span> So off I tooled, and
found old Congers just thinking of turning in.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘My clients are sometimes unnecessarily
discreet’</span>, he remarked in his pompous way when I told him about
the arrival, and of course he added his usual platitude
about our reputation for discretion.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I went back with him to the waiting-room, and just
stood at the door long enough to see him hail the doctor
chap very cordially and be introduced to the patient’s
cousin, and then I came away. Rather rum, isn’t
it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You’ve certainly made the best of the yarn,”</span> said
Escott with a laugh.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg19" id="Pg19" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By George, if you’d been there you’d have thought
it funny too.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, good-night, I’m off. We’ll probably hear
to-morrow what it’s all about.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the morning there was little more to be learned
about the new-comer’s history and antecedents. Dr
Congleton spoke of the matter to the two young men,
with the pompous cough that signified extreme discretion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Brought by an old friend of mine,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
curious story, Escott, but quite intelligible. There seem
to be the best reasons for answering no questions about
him; you understand?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, sir,”</span> said the two assistants, with the more
assurance as they had no information to give.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am perfectly satisfied, mind you—perfectly satisfied,”</span>
added their chief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By the way, sir,”</span> Sherlaw ventured to remark, <span class="tei tei-q">“hadn’t
they given him something in the way of a sleeping-draught?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Eh? Indeed? I hardly think so, Sherlaw, I hardly
think so. Case of reaction entirely. Good morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Congleton seems satisfied,”</span> remarked Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll tell you what,”</span> said the junior, profoundly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Old Congers is a very good chap, and all that, but he’s
not what I should call extra sharp.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> should feel uncommon
suspicious.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“H’m,”</span> replied Escott. <span class="tei tei-q">“As you say, our worthy
chief is not extra sharp. But that’s not our business,
after all.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By the way,”</span> said Escott, a couple of days later,
<span class="tei tei-q">“how is your mysterious man getting on? I haven’t
seen him myself yet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sherlaw laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He’s turning out a regular sportsman, by George!
For the first day he was more or less in the same state in
which he arrived. Then he began to wake up and ask
questions. <span class="tei tei-q">‘What the devil is this place?’</span> he said to me
in the evening. It may sound profane, but he was very
polite, I assure you. I told him, and he sort of raised
his eyebrows, smiled, and thanked me like a Prime
Minister acknowledging an obligation. Since then he
has steadily developed sporting, not to say frisky, tastes.
He went out this morning, and in five minutes had his
arm round one of the prettiest nurses’ waist. And she
didn’t seem to mind much either, by George!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He’ll want a bit of looking after, I take it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Seems to me he is uncommonly capable of taking
care of himself. The rest of the establishment will want
looking after, though.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this time forth the mysterious gentleman began
to regularly take the air and to be remarked, and having
once remarked him, people looked again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Francis Beveridge, for such it appeared was his
name, was distinguished even for Clankwood. Though
his antecedents were involved in mystery, so much confidence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg21" id="Pg21" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was placed in Dr Congleton’s discrimination
that the unknown stranger was at once received on the
most friendly terms by every one; and, to tell the truth,
it would have been hard to repulse him for long. His
manner was perfect, his conversation witty to the extremest
verge of propriety, and his clothes, fashionable
in cut and of unquestionable fit, bore on such of the
buttons as were made of metal the hall mark of a leading
London firm. He wore the longest and most silky
moustaches ever seen, and beneath them a short well-tended
beard completed his resemblance—so the ladies
declared—to King Charles of unhappy memory. The
melancholic Mr Jones (quondam author of ‘Sunflowers—A
Lyrical Medley’) declared, indeed, that for Mr
Beveridge shaving was prohibited, and darkly whispered
<span class="tei tei-q">“suicidal,”</span> but his opinion was held of little account.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was upon a morning about a week after his arrival
that Dr Escott, alone in the billiard-room, saw him enter.
Escott had by this time made his acquaintance, and,
like almost everybody else, had already succumbed to
the fascination of his address.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good morning, doctor,”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you to do
me a trifling favour, a mere bending of your eyes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Escott laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be delighted. What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge unbuttoned his waistcoat and displayed
his shirt-front.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I only want you to be good enough to read the inscription
written here.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor bent down.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg22" id="Pg22" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Francis Beveridge,’</span> ”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“That’s
all I see.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And that’s all I see,”</span> said Mr Beveridge. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now
what can you read here? I am not troubling you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He held out his handkerchief as he spoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not a bit,”</span> laughed the doctor, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I only see <span class="tei tei-q">‘Francis
Beveridge’</span> here too, I’m afraid.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Everything has got it,”</span> said Mr Beveridge, shaking
his head, it would be hard to say whether humorously
or sadly. <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Francis Beveridge’</span> on everything. It follows,
I suppose, that I am Francis Beveridge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What else?”</span> asked Escott, who was much amused.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That’s just it. What else?”</span> said the other. He
smiled a peculiarly charming smile, thanked the doctor
with exaggerated gratitude, and strolled out again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He is a rum chap,”</span> reflected Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And indeed in the outside world he might safely have
been termed rather rum, but here in this backwater,
so full of the oddest flotsam, his waywardness was rather
less than the average. He had, for instance, a diverting
habit of modifying the time, and even the tune, of the
hymns on Sunday, and he confessed to having kissed
all the nurses and housemaids except three. But both
Escott and Sherlaw declared they had never met a more
congenial spirit. Mr Beveridge’s game of billiards was
quite remarkable even for Clankwood, where the enforced
leisure of many of the noblemen and gentlemen had
made them highly proficient on the spot; he showed every
promise, on his rare opportunities, of being an unusually
entertaining small hour, whisky-and-soda
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">raconteur</span></span>; in
fact, he was evidently a man whose previous career,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg23" id="Pg23" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whatever it might have been (and his own statements
merely served to increase the mystery round this point),
had led him through many humorous by-paths, and left
him with few restrictive prejudices.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">November became December, and to all appearances
he had settled down in his new residence with complete
resignation, when that unknowable factor that upsets so
many calculations came upon the scene,—the factor, I
mean, that wears a petticoat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge strolled into Escott’s room one morning
to find the doctor inspecting a mixed assortment of white
kid gloves.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do these mean past or future conquests?”</span> he asked
with his smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Both,”</span> laughed the doctor. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’m trying to pick out
a clean pair for the dance to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You go a-dancing, then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t you know it’s our own monthly ball here?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course,”</span> said Mr Beveridge, passing his hand
quickly across his brow. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must have heard, but things
pass so quickly through my head nowadays.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He laughed a little conventional laugh, and gazed at
the gloves.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are coming, of course?”</span> said Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you can lend me a pair of these. Can you spare
one?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Help yourself,”</span> replied the doctor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge selected a pair with the care of a man
who is particular in such matters, put them in his pocket,
thanked the doctor, and went out.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg24" id="Pg24" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hope he doesn’t play the fool,”</span> thought Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Invitations to the balls at Clankwood were naturally
in great demand throughout the county, for nowhere
were noblemen so numerous and divinities so tangible.
Carriages and pairs rolled up one after another, the
mansion glittered with lights, the strains of the band
could be heard loud and stirring or low and faintly all
through the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is that man dancing opposite my daughter?”</span>
asked the Countess of Grillyer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A Mr Beveridge,”</span> replied Dr Congleton.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge, in fact, the mark of all eyes, was dancing
in a set of lancers. The couple opposite to him consisted
of a stout elderly gentleman who, doubtless for the best
reasons, styled himself the Emperor of the two Americas,
and a charming little pink and flaxen partner—the Lady
Alicia à Fyre, as everybody who was anybody could have
told you. The handsome stranger moved, as might be
expected, with his accustomed grace and air of distinction,
and, probably to convince his admirers that there
was nothing meretricious in his performance, he carried
his hands in his pockets the whole time. This certainly
caused a little inconvenience to his partner, but to be
characteristic in Clankwood one had to step very far out
of the beaten track.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For two figures the Emperor snorted disapproval,
but at the end of the third, when Mr Beveridge had been
skipping round the outskirts of the set, his hands still
thrust out of sight, somewhat to the derangement of the
customary procedure, he could contain himself no longer.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg25" id="Pg25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hey, young man!”</span> he asked in his most stentorian
voice, as the music ceased, <span class="tei tei-q">“are you afraid of having your
pockets picked?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> replied Mr Beveridge, <span class="tei tei-q">“it would take two men
to do that.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Huh!”</span> snorted the Emperor, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are so d—d strong,
are you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I mean,”</span> answered his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis-à-vis</span></span> with his polite smile,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that it would take one man to put something in and
another to take it out.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This remark not only turned the laugh entirely on Mr
Beveridge’s side, but it introduced the upsetting factor.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lady Alicia à Fyre, though of the outer everyday
world herself, had, in common with most families of any
pretensions to ancient dignity, a creditable sprinkling
of uncles and cousins domiciled in Clankwood, and so
she frequently attended these dances.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To-night her eye had been caught by a tall, graceful
figure executing a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pas seul</span></span>
in the middle of the room with
its hands in its pockets. The face of this gentleman was
so composed and handsome, and he seemed so oblivious
to the presence of everybody else, that her interest was
immediately excited. During the set of lancers in which
he was her <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis-à-vis</span></span> she
watched him furtively with a
growing feeling of admiration. She had never heard him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg26" id="Pg26" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
say a word, and it was with a sensation of the liveliest
interest that she listened to his brief passage with her
partner. At his final retort her tender heart was overcome
with pity. He was poor, then, or at least he was
allowed the use of no money. And all of him that was
outside his pockets seemed so sane and so gentlemanly;
it seemed a pity to let him lack a little sympathy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lady Alicia might be described as a becoming
frock stuffed with sentiment. Through a pair of large
blue eyes she drank in romance, and with the reddest
and most undecided of lips she felt a vague desire to kiss
something. At the end of the dance she managed by
a series of little manœuvres to find herself standing close
to his elbow. She sighed twice, but he still seemed absorbed
in his thoughts. Then with a heroic effort she
summed up her courage, and said in a low and rather
shaky voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“You—you—you are unha—appy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge turned and looked down on her with
great interest. Her eyes met his for a moment and
straightway sought the floor. Thus she saw nothing of
a smile that came and went like the shadow of a puff of
smoke. He took his hands out of his pockets, folded his
arms, and, with an air of the deepest dejection, sighed
heavily. She took courage and looked up again, and then,
as he only gazed into space in the most romantically melancholy
fashion and made no answer, she asked again
very timidly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wh—what is the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without saying a word Mr Beveridge bent courteously
and offered her his right arm. She took it with the
most delicious trepidation, glancing round hurriedly to see
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg27" id="Pg27" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whether the Countess noticed her. Another dance was
just beginning, and in the general movement her mysterious
acquaintance led her without observation to a
seat in the window of a corridor. There he pressed her
hand gently, stroked his long moustaches for a minute,
and then said, with an air of reflection: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are three
ways of making a woman like one. I am slightly out of
practice. Would you be kind enough to suggest a
method of procedure?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a beginning was so wholly unexpected that Lady
Alicia could only give a little gasp of consternation.
Her companion, after pausing an instant for a reply,
went on in the same tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am aware that I have begun
well. I attracted your attention, I elicited your sympathy,
and I pressed your hand; but for the life of me I can’t
remember what I generally do next.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Lady Alicia, who had come with a bucketful of
sympathy ready to be gulped down by this unfortunate
gentleman, was only able to stammer, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—I really
don’t know, Mr&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hamilton,”</span> said Mr Beveridge, unblushingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“At
least that name belongs to me as much as anything can
be said to in a world where my creditors claim my money
and Dr Congleton my person.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are confined and poor, you mean?”</span> asked Lady
Alicia, beginning to see her way again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Poor and confined, to put them in their proper order,
for if I had the wherewithal to purchase a balloon I should
certainly cease to be confined.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His admirer found it hard to reply adequately to this,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg28" id="Pg28" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Mr Beveridge continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“To return to the delicate
subject from which we strayed, what would you like me to
do,—put my arm round your waist, relate my troubles,
or turn my back on you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are—are those the three ways you spoke of—to
make women like you, I mean?”</span> Lady Alicia ventured to
ask, though she was beginning to wish the sofa was
larger.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They are examples of the three classical methods:
cuddling, humbugging, and piquing. Which do you
prefer?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me about your—your troubles,”</span> she answered,
gaining courage a little.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You belong to the sex which makes no mention of
figs and spades,”</span> he rejoined; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I understand you to
mean that you prefer humbugging.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He drew a long face, sighed twice, and looking tenderly
into Lady Alicia’s blue eyes, began in a gentle, reminiscent
voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“My boyhood was troubled and unhappy: no kind
words, no caresses. I was beaten by a cruel stepfather,
ignored and insulted for my physical deformities by a
heartless stepmother.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped to sigh again, and Lady Alicia, with a boldness
that surprised herself, and a perspicacity that would
have surprised her friends, asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“How could they—I
mean, were they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></span> step?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Several steps,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“in fact, quite a long
journey.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this explanation Lady Alicia was forced to remain
satisfied; but as he had paused a second time, and seemed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg29" id="Pg29" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be immersed in the study of his shoes, she inquired
again, <span class="tei tei-q">“You spoke of physical infirmities; do you
mean&mdash;&mdash;?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Deformities,”</span> he corrected; <span class="tei tei-q">“up to the age of fourteen
years I could only walk sideways, and my hair parted in
the middle.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He spoke so seriously that these unusual maladies
seemed to her the most touching misfortunes she had
ever heard of. She murmured gently, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As the years advanced,”</span> Mr Beveridge continued,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and I became more nearly the same weight as my stepfather,
my life grew happier. It was decided to send me
to college, so I was provided with an insufficient cheque,
a complete set of plated forks, and three bath-towels,
and despatched to the University of Oxford. At least
I think that was the name of the corporation which took
my money and endeavoured to restrict my habits, though,
to confess the truth, my memory is not what it used to be.
There I learned wisdom by the practice of folly—the
most amusing and effective method. My tutor used to
tell me I had some originality. I apologised for its presence
in such a respectable institution, and undertook
to pass an examination instead. I believe I succeeded:
I certainly remember giving a dinner to celebrate something.
Thereupon at my own expense the University
inflicted a degree upon me, but I was shortly afterwards
compensated by the death of my uncle and my accession
to his estates. Having enjoyed a university education,
and accordingly possessing a corrected and regulated
sentiment, I was naturally inconsolable at the decease of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg30" id="Pg30" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this venerable relative, who for so long had shown a
kindly interest in the poor orphan lad.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped to sigh again, and Lady Alicia asked with
great interest, <span class="tei tei-q">“But your step-parents, you always had
them, hadn’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Never!”</span> he replied, sadly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Never?”</span> she exclaimed in some bewilderment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly not often,”</span> he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“and oftener than
not, never. If you had told me beforehand you wished
to hear my history, I should have pruned my family
tree into a more presentable shape. But if you will
kindly tell me as I go along which of my relatives you
disapprove of, and who you would like to be introduced,
I shall arrange the plot to suit you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I only wish to hear the true story, Mr Hamilton.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Fortescue,”</span> he corrected. <span class="tei tei-q">“I certainly prefer to be
called by one name at a time, but never by the same
twice running.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He smiled so agreeably as he said this that Lady Alicia,
though puzzled and a little hurt, could not refrain from
smiling back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let me hear the rest,”</span> she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is no truer than the first part, but quite as entertaining.
So, if you like, I shall endeavour to recall the
series of painful episodes that brought me to Clankwood,”</span>
he answered, very seriously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia settled herself comfortably into one corner of
the sofa and prepared to feel affected. But at that moment
the portly form of Dr Congleton appeared from the direction
of the ballroom with a still more portly dowager on his arm.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg31" id="Pg31" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My mother!”</span> exclaimed Lady Alicia, rising quickly
to her feet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed?”</span> said Mr Beveridge, who still kept his seat.
<span class="tei tei-q">“She certainly looks handsome enough.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This speech made Lady Alicia blush very becomingly,
and the Countess looked at her sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where have you been, Alicia?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The room was rather warm, mamma, and&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In short, madam,”</span> interrupted Mr Beveridge, rising
and bowing, <span class="tei tei-q">“your charming daughter wished to study
a lunatic at close quarters. I am mad, and I obligingly
raved. Thus&mdash;&mdash;”</span> He ran one hand through his hair
so as to make it fall over his eyes, blew out his cheeks,
and uttering a yell, sprang high into the air, and descended
in a sitting posture on the floor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That, madam, is a very common symptom,”</span> he explained,
with a smile, smoothing down his hair again, <span class="tei tei-q">“as
our friend Dr Congleton will tell you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both the doctor and the Countess were too astonished
to make any reply, so he turned again to Lady Alicia,
and offering his arm, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me lead you back to our
fellow-fools.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is he safe?”</span> whispered the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I believe so,”</span> replied Dr Congleton in some
confusion; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I shall have him watched more carefully.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they entered the room Mr Beveridge whispered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will you meet a poor lunatic again?”</span> And the Lady
Alicia pressed his arm.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the morning after the dance Dr Congleton summoned
Dr Escott to his room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Escott,”</span> he began, <span class="tei tei-q">“we must keep a little sharper
eye on Mr Beveridge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed, sir?”</span> said Escott; <span class="tei tei-q">“he seems to me harmless
enough.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless, he must be watched. Lady Grillyer
was considerably alarmed by his conduct last night,
and a client who has confided so many of her relatives
to my care must be treated with the greatest regard. I
receive pheasants at Christmas from no fewer than fourteen
families of title, and my reputation for discretion
is too valuable to be risked. When Mr Beveridge is
not under your own eyes you must see that Moggridge
always keeps him in sight.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly Moggridge, a burly and seasoned attendant
on refractory patients, was told off to keep an unobtrusive
eye on that accomplished gentleman. His duties appeared
light enough, for, as I have said, Mr Beveridge’s eccentricities
had hitherto been merely of the most playful
nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After luncheon on this same day he gave Escott twelve
breaks and a beating at billiards, and then having borrowed
and approved of one of his cigars, he strolled into
the park. If he intended to escape observation, he certainly
showed the most skilful strategy, for he dodged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg33" id="Pg33" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deviously through the largest trees, and at last, after a
roundabout ramble, struck a sheltered walk that ran
underneath the high, glass-decked outer wall. It was
a sunny winter afternoon. The boughs were stripped,
and the leaves lay littered on the walk or flickered and
stirred through the grass. In this spot the high trees
stood so close and the bare branches were so thick that
there was still an air of quiet and seclusion where he
paced and smoked. Every now and then he stopped and
listened and looked at his watch, and as he walked backwards
and forwards an amused smile would come and go.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once he heard something move on the far side
of the wall: he paused to make sure, and then he whistled,
<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E1" id="E1" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e1" class="tei tei-ref">the</a></span>
sounds outside ceased, and in a moment something
fell softly behind him. He turned quickly and snatched
up a little buttonhole of flowers with a still smaller note
tied to the stems.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“An uncommonly happy idea,”</span> he said to himself,
looking at the missive with the air of one versed in these
matters. Then he leisurely proceeded to unfold and read
the note.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To my friend,”</span> he read, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I may call you a friend,
since I have known you only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">such a
short time</span></span>—may I?
This is just to express my sympathy, and although I
cannot express it well, still perhaps you will forgive my
feeble effort!!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point, just as he was regarding the double
mark of exclamation with reminiscent entertainment, a
plaintive voice from the other side of the wall cried in a
stage whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“Have you got it?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg34" id="Pg34" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge composed his face, and heaving his
shoulders to his ears in the effort, gave vent to a prodigious
sigh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A million thanks, my fairest and kindest of friends,”</span>
he answered in the same tone. <span class="tei tei-q">“I read it now: I drink
it in, I&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He kissed the back of his hand loudly two or three
times, sighed again, and continued his reading.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I could help you,”</span> it ran, <span class="tei tei-q">“but I am afraid I
cannot, as the world is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">so
censorious</span></span>, is it not? So you
must accept a friend’s sympathy if it does not seem to
you too bold and forward of her!!! Perhaps we may
meet again, as I sometimes go to Clankwood. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Au revoir.</span></span>—Your sympathetic
well-wisher. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A. à. F.</span></span>”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He folded it up and put it in his waistcoat-pocket,
then he exclaimed in an audible aside, his voice shaking
with the most affecting thrill, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perhaps</span></span> we may meet
again! Only <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">perhaps!</span></span> O
Alicia!”</span> And then dropping
again into a stage whisper, he asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you still
there, Lady Alicia?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A timorous voice replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, Mr Fortescue. But I
really <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></span> go now!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now? So soon?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have stayed too long already.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis better to have stayed too long than never to wear
stays at all,”</span> replied Mr Beveridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no response for a moment. Then a low
voice, a little hurt and a good deal puzzled, asked with
evident hesitation, <span class="tei tei-q">“What—what did you say, Mr
Fortescue?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg35" id="Pg35" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I said that Lady Alicia’s stay cannot be too long,”</span>
he answered, softly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—but what good can I be?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The good you cannot help being.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another moment’s pause, then the voice
whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t quite understand you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My Alicia understands me not!”</span> Mr Beveridge
soliloquised in another audible aside. Aloud, or rather
in a little lower tone, he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am friendless,
poor, and imprisoned. What is the good in your staying?
Ah, Lady Alicia! But why should I detain you? Go,
fair friend! Go and forget poor Francis Beveridge!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There came a soft, surprised answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Francis Beveridge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! you have guessed my secret. Yes, that is the
name of the unhappiest of mortals.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke these melancholy words he threw away
the stump of his cigar, took another from his case, and
bit off the end.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The voice replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall remember it—among my
friends.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge struck a match.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“H’sh! Whatever is that?”</span> cried the voice in alarm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A heart breaking,”</span> he replied, lighting his cigar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t talk like that,”</span> said the voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“It—it
distresses me.”</span> There was a break in the voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And, alas! between distress and consolation there
are fifteen perpendicular feet of stone and mortar and
the relics of twelve hundred bottles of Bass,”</span> he replied.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg36" id="Pg36" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps,”</span>—the voice hesitated—<span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps we may
see each other some day.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Say to-morrow at four o’clock,”</span> he suggested, pertinently.
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you could manage to be passing up the
drive at that hour.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another pause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</span> the voice began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that moment he heard the sharp crack of a branch
behind him, and turning instantly he spied the uncompromising
countenance of Moggridge peering round a
tree about twenty paces distant. Lack of presence of
mind and quick decision were not amongst Mr Beveridge’s
failings. He struck a theatrical attitude at once,
and began in a loud voice, gazing up at the tops of the
trees, <span class="tei tei-q">“He comes! A stranger comes! Yes, my fair
friend, we may meet again. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Au
revoir</span></span>, but only for a
while! Ah, that a breaking heart should be lit for a
moment and then the lamp be put out!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile Moggridge was walking towards him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, Moggridge!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“Good day.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Time you was goin’ in, sir,”</span> said Moggridge, stolidly;
and to himself he muttered, <span class="tei tei-q">“He’s crackeder than I
thought, a-shoutin’ and a-ravin’ to hisself. Just as well
I kept a heye on ’im.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like most clever people, Mr Beveridge generally followed
the line of least resistance. He slipped his arm
through his attendant’s, shouted a farewell apparently
to some imaginary divinity overhead, and turned towards
the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is an unexpected pleasure,”</span> he remarked.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg37" id="Pg37" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir,”</span> replied Moggridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Funny thing your turning up. Out for a walk, I
suppose?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For a stroll, sir—that’s to say&mdash;&mdash;”</span> he stopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That on these chilly afternoons the dear good doctor
is afraid of my health?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That’s kind o’ it, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But of course I’m not supposed to notice anything,
eh?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moggridge looked a trifle uncomfortable and was discreetly
silent. Mr Beveridge smiled at his own perspicacity,
and then began in the most friendly tone,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I feel flattered that so stout a man has been told
off to take care of me. What an arm you’ve got, man.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pretty fair, sir,”</span> said Moggridge, complacently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And I am thankful, too,”</span> continued Mr Beveridge,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that you’re a man of some sense. There are a lot of
fools in the world, Moggridge, and I’m somewhat of an
epicure in the matter of heads.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mine ’as been considered pretty sharp,”</span> Moggridge
admitted, with a gratified relaxation of his wooden countenance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have a cigar?”</span> his patient asked, taking out his
case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, sir, I don’t mind if I do.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You will find it a capital smoke. I don’t throw them
away on every one.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moggridge, completely thawed, lit his cigar and slackened
his pace, for such frank appreciation of his merits
was rare in a critical world.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg38" id="Pg38" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You can perhaps believe, Moggridge,”</span> said Mr
Beveridge, reflectively, <span class="tei tei-q">“that one doesn’t often have the
chance of talking confidentially to a man of sense in
Clankwood.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir, I should himagine not.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And so one has sometimes to talk to oneself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was said so sadly that Moggridge began to feel
uncomfortably affected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, Moggridge, one cannot always keep silence,
even when one least wants to be overheard. Have you
ever been in love, Moggridge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The burly keeper changed countenance a little at this
embarrassingly direct question, and answered diffidently,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, sir, to be sure men is men and woming will be
woming.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The deuce, they will!”</span> replied Mr Beveridge, cordially;
<span class="tei tei-q">“and it’s rather hard to forget ’em, eh?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hindeed it is, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I remembered this afternoon, but I should like you
as a good chap to forget. You won’t mention my moment
of weakness, Moggridge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> said Moggridge, stoutly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose I
hought to report what I sees, but I won’t this time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you,”</span> said Mr Beveridge, pressing his arm.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I had, you know, a touch of the sun in India, and I
sometimes talk when I shouldn’t. Though, after all,
that isn’t a very uncommon complaint.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so it happened that no rumour prejudicial either
to his sanity or to the progress of his friendship with the
Lady Alicia reached the ears of the authorities.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards four o’clock on the following afternoon Mr
Beveridge and Moggridge were walking leisurely down
the long drive leading from the mansion of Clankwood
to the gate that opened on the humdrum outer world.
Finding that an inelastic matter of yards was all the
tether he could hope for, Mr Beveridge thought it best
to take the bull by the horns, and make a companion of
this necessity. So he kept his attendant by his side,
and regaled him for some time with a series of improbable
reminiscences and tolerable cigars, till at last, round a
bend of the avenue, a lady on horseback came into view.
As she drew a little nearer he stopped with an air of great
surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I believe, Moggridge, that must be Lady Alicia à
Fyre!”</span> he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It looks huncommon like her, sir,”</span> replied Moggridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I must really speak to her. She was”</span>—and Mr
Beveridge assumed his inimitable air of manly sentiment—<span class="tei tei-q">“she
was one of my poor mother’s dearest friends.
Do you mind, Moggridge, falling behind a little? In
fact, if you could step behind a tree and wait here for
me, it would be pleasanter for us both. We used to
meet under happier circumstances, and, don’t you know,
it might distress her to be reminded of my misfortunes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a reasonable request, beseechingly put by so fine
a gentleman, could scarcely be refused. Moggridge retired
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg40" id="Pg40" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
behind the trees that lined the avenue, and Mr
Beveridge advanced alone to meet the Lady Alicia.
She blushed very becomingly as he raised his hat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hardly expected to see you to-day, Mr Beveridge,”</span>
she began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I, on the other hand, have been thinking of nothing
else,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She blushed still deeper, but responded a little reprovingly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“It’s very polite of you to say so, but&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not a bit,”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have a dozen equally well-turned
sentences at my disposal, and, they tell me, a
most deluding way of saying them.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Suddenly out of her depth again, poor Lady Alicia
could only strike out at random.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who tell you?”</span> she managed to say.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“First, so far as my poor memory goes, my mother’s
lady’s-maid informed me of the fact; then I think my sister’s
governess,”</span> he replied, ticking off his informants on his
fingers with a half-abstracted air. <span class="tei tei-q">“After that came a
number of more or less reliable individuals, and lastly
the Lady Alicia à Fyre.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Me? I’m sure I never said&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“None of them
ever <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">said</span></span>,”</span> he interrupted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But what have I done, then?”</span> she asked, tightening
her reins, and making her horse fidget a foot or two farther
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have begun to be a most adorable friend to a
most unfortunate man.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still Lady Alicia looked at him a little dubiously, and
only said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—I hope I’m not too friendly.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg41" id="Pg41" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There are no degrees in friendly,”</span> he replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“There
are only aloofly, friendly, and more than friendly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I think I ought to be going on, Mr Beveridge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That experienced diplomatist perceived that it was
necessary to further embellish himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you fond of soldiers?”</span> he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon?”</span> she said in considerable bewilderment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does a red coat, a medal, and a brass band appeal to
you? Are you apt to be interested in her Majesty’s army?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I generally like soldiers,”</span> she admitted, still much
surprised at the turn the conversation had taken.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I was a soldier.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—really?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I held a commission in one of the crackest cavalry
regiments,”</span> he began dramatically, and yet with a great
air of sincerity. <span class="tei tei-q">“I was considered one of the most
promising officers in the mess. It nearly broke my heart
to leave the service.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He turned away his head. Lady Alicia was visibly
affected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am so sorry!”</span> she murmured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still keeping his face turned away, he held out his
hand and she pressed it gently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sorrow cannot give me my freedom,”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If there is anything I can do&mdash;&mdash;”</span> she began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dismount,”</span> he said, looking up at her tenderly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia never quite knew how it happened,
but certainly she found herself standing on the ground,
and the next moment Mr Beveridge was in her place.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg42" id="Pg42" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“An old soldier,”</span> he exclaimed, gaily; <span class="tei tei-q">“I can’t resist
the temptation of having a canter.”</span> And with that he
started at a gallop towards the gate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a blasphemous ejaculation Moggridge sprang
from behind his tree, and set off down the drive in hot
pursuit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia screamed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Stop! stop! Francis—I mean,
Mr Beveridge; stop, please!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the favorite of the crack regiment, despite the
lady’s saddle, sat his steed well, and rapidly left cries
and footsteps far behind. The lodge was nearly half a
mile away, and as the avenue wound between palisades
of old trees, the shouts became muffled, and when he
looked over his shoulder he saw in the stretch behind him
no sign of benefactress or pursuer. By continued exhortations
and the point of his penknife he kept his horse
at full stretch; round the next bend he knew he should
see the gates.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Five to one on the blank things being shut,”</span> he
muttered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He swept round the curve, and there ahead of him he
saw the gates grimly closed, and at the lodge door a dismounted
groom, standing beside his horse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only remarking <span class="tei tei-q">“Damn!”</span> he reined up, turned,
and trotted quietly back again. Presently he met Moggridge,
red in the face, muddy as to his trousers, and
panting hard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nice little nag this, Moggridge,”</span> he remarked, airily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nice sweat you’ve give me,”</span> rejoined his attendant,
wrathfully.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg43" id="Pg43" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You don’t mean to say you ran after me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I does mean to say,”</span> Moggridge replied grimly,
seizing the reins.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Want to lead him? Very well—it makes us look
quite like the Derby winner coming in.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Derby loser you means, thanks to them gates bein’
shut.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gates shut? Were they? I didn’t happen to
notice.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, o’ course not,”</span> said Moggridge, sarcastically;
<span class="tei tei-q">“that there sunstroke you got in India prevented you, I
suppose?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have a cigar?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this overture Moggridge made no reply. Mr
Beveridge laughed and continued lightly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I had no
idea you were so fond of exercise. I’d have given you
a lead all round the park if I’d known.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You’d ’ave given me a lead all round the county if
them gates ’ad been open.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It might have been difficult to stop this fiery animal,”</span>
Mr Beveridge admitted. <span class="tei tei-q">“But now, Moggridge, the run
is over. I think I can take Lady Alicia’s horse back to
her myself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moggridge smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You won’t let go?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No fears.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge put his hand behind his back and silently
drove the penknife a quarter of an inch into his mount’s
hind quarters. In an instant his keeper felt himself
being lifted nearly off his feet, and in another actually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg44" id="Pg44" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deposited on his face. Off went the accomplished horseman
again at top speed, but this time back to Lady Alicia.
He saw her standing by the side of the drive, her handkerchief
to her eyes, a penitent and disconsolate little
figure. When she heard him coming, she dried her eyes
and looked up, but her face was still tearful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I am back from my ride,”</span> he remarked in a
perfectly usual voice, dismounting as he spoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The man!”</span> she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“where is that dreadful man?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What man?”</span> he asked in some surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The man who chased you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge laughed aloud, at which Lady Alicia
took fresh refuge in her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He follows on foot,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Did he catch you? Oh, why didn’t you escape
altogether?”</span> she sobbed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge looked at her with growing interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had begun to forget my petticoat psychology,”</span> he
reflected (aloud, after his unconventional fashion).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, here he comes,”</span> she shuddered. <span class="tei tei-q">“All blood!
Oh, what have you done to him?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“On my honour, nothing,—I merely haven’t washed
his face.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time Moggridge was coming close upon them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You won’t forget a poor soldier?”</span> said Mr Beveridge
in a lower voice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">poor</span></span> soldier,”</span> he
added, with a sigh, glancing at
her from the corner of his eye. <span class="tei tei-q">“So poor that even if
I had got out, I could only have ridden till I dropped.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg45" id="Pg45" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Would you accept&mdash;&mdash;?”</span> she began, timidly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What day?”</span> he interrupted, hurriedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tuesday,”</span> she hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Four o’clock, again. Same place as before. When
I whistle throw it over at once.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before they had time to say more, Moggridge, blood- and
gravel-stained, came up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s all right, miss,”</span> he said, coming between them;
<span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll see that he plays no more of ’is tricks.
There’s nothin’ to be afrightened of.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Stand back!”</span> she cried; <span class="tei tei-q">“don’t come near me!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moggridge was too staggered at this outburst to say
a word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Stand away!”</span> she said, and the bewildered attendant
stood away. She turned to Mr Beveridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now, will you help me up?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She mounted lightly, said a brief farewell, and, forgetting
all about the call at Clankwood she had ostensibly
come to pay, turned her horse’s head towards the lodge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I’m blowed!”</span> said Moggridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They do blow one,”</span> his patient assented.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally enough the story of this equestrian adventure
soon ran through Clankwood. The exact particulars,
however, were a little hard to collect, for while Moggridge
supplied many minute and picturesque details,
illustrating his own activity and presence of mind and
the imminent peril of the Lady Alicia, Mr Beveridge recounted
an equally vivid story of a runaway horse recovered
by himself to its fair owner’s unbounded gratitude.
Official opinion naturally accepted the official
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg46" id="Pg46" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
account, and for the next few days Mr Beveridge became
an object of considerable anxiety and mistrust.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can’t make the man out,”</span> said Sherlaw to Escott.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I had begun to think there was nothing much the matter
with him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No more there is,”</span> replied Escott. <span class="tei tei-q">“His memory
seems to me to have suffered from something, and he
simply supplies its place in conversation from his imagination,
and in action from the inspiration of the moment.
The methods of society are too orthodox for such an
aberration, and as his friends doubtless pay a handsome
fee to keep him here, old Congers labels him mad and
locks the door on him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A day or two afterwards official opinion was a little
disturbed. Lady Alicia, in reply to anxious inquiries,
gave a third version of the adventure, from which nothing
in particular could be gathered except that nothing in
particular had happened.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you make of this, Escott?”</span> asked Dr Congleton,
laying her note before his assistant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Merely that a woman wrote it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hum! I suppose that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> the
explanation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon which the doctor looked profound and went to
lunch.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two five-pound notes, half-a-sovereign, and seven
and sixpence in silver,”</span> said Mr Beveridge to himself.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, and a card.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg47" id="Pg47" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the card was written, <span class="tei tei-q">“From a friend, if you will
accept it. A.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was standing under the wall, in the secluded walk,
holding a little lady’s purse in his hand, and listening
to two different footsteps. One little pair of feet were
hurrying away on the farther side of the high wall, another
and larger were approaching him at a run.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Wot’s he bin up to now, I wonder,”</span> Moggridge
panted to himself—for the second pair of feet belonged
to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shamming nose-bleed and sending me in
for an ’andkerchief, and then sneaking off here by
’isself!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What a time you’ve been,”</span> said Mr Beveridge, slipping
the purse with its contents into his pocket. <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
so infernally cold I had to take a little walk. Got the
handkerchief?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In silence and with a suspicious solemnity Moggridge
handed him the handkerchief, and they turned back for
the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now for a balloon,”</span> Mr Beveridge reflected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly it was cold. The frost nipped sharp that
night, and next morning there were ice gardens on the
windows, and the park lay white all through the winter
sunshine.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By evening the private lake was reported to be bearing,
and the next day it hummed under the first skaters.
Hardly necessary to say Mr Beveridge was among the
earliest of them, or that he was at once the object of
general admiration and envy. He traced <span class="tei tei-q">“vines”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“Q’s,”</span> and performed wonderful feats on one leg all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg48" id="Pg48" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
morning. At lunch he was in the best of spirits, and was
off again at once to the ice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he reached the lake in the afternoon the first
person he spied was Lady Alicia, and five minutes afterwards
they were sailing off together hand in hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I knew you would come to-day,”</span> he remarked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></span> you have
known? It was by the merest chance I happened to come.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It has always been by the merest chance that any
of them have ever come.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who have ever come?”</span> she inquired, with a vague
feeling that he had said something he ought not to have,
and that she was doing the same.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Many things,”</span> he smiled, <span class="tei tei-q">“including purses. Which
reminds me that I am eternally your debtor.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She blushed and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I hope you didn’t mind.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not much,”</span> he answered, candidly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In my present
circumstances a five-pound note is more acceptable than
a caress.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lady Alicia again remembered the maidenly
proprieties, and tried to change the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What beautiful ice!”</span> she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The question now is,”</span> he continued, paying no heed
to this diversion, <span class="tei tei-q">“what am I to do next?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span> she asked a little faintly,
realising dimly that she was being regarded as a fellow-conspirator
in some unlawful project.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The wall is high, there is bottle-glass on the top, and
I shall find it hard to bring away a fresh pair of trousers,
and probably draughty if I don’t. The gates are always
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg49" id="Pg49" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
kept closed, and it isn’t worth any one’s while to open
them for £10, 17s. 6d., less the price of a first-class ticket
up to town. What are we to do?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We?”</span> she gasped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You and I,”</span> he explained.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—but I can’t <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">possibly</span></span> do anything.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Can’t possibly’</span> is a phrase I have learned
to misunderstand.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Really, Mr Beveridge, I mustn’t do anything.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mustn’t is an invariable preface to a sin. Never
use it; it’s a temptation in itself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It wouldn’t be right,”</span> she said, with quite a show of
firmness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked at her a little curiously. For a moment he
almost seemed puzzled. Then he pressed her hand and
asked tenderly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in a half-audible aside he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“That’s the
correct move, I think.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What did you say?”</span> she asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Why not?’</span> ”</span> he answered, with increasing
tenderness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But you said something else.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I added a brief prayer for pity.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia sighed and repeated a little less firmly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It wouldn’t be right of me, Mr Beveridge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But what would be wrong?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was said with even more fervour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My conscience—we are very particular, you know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are <span class="tei tei-q">‘we’</span>?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Papa is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></span> strict
High Church.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg50" id="Pg50" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An idea seemed to strike Mr Beveridge, for he ruminated
in silence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I asked Mr Candles—our curate, you know,”</span> Lady
Alicia continued, with a heroic effort to make her position
clear.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You told him!”</span> he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I didn’t say who it was—I mean what it was I
thought of doing—I mean the temptation—that is, the
possibility. And he said it was very kind of me to think
of it; but I mustn’t do anything, and he advised me to
read a book he gave me, and—and I mustn’t think of
it, really, Mr Beveridge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To himself Mr Beveridge repeated under his breath,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Archbishops, bishops, deacons, curates, fast in Lent,
and an anthem after the Creed. I think I remember
enough to pass.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he assumed a very serious face, and said aloud,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your scruples do your heart credit. They have given
me an insight into your deep and sweet character, which
emboldens me to make a confession.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped skating, folded his arms, and continued
unblushingly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was educated for the Church, but
the prejudices of my parents, the immature scepticism
of youth, and some uncertainty about obtaining my
archbishopric, induced me in an unfortunate moment,
which I never ceased to bitterly regret, to quit my
orders.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are in orders?”</span> she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was in several. I cancelled them, and entered the
Navy instead.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg51" id="Pg51" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Navy?”</span> she asked, excusably bewildered by
these rapid changes of occupation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For five years I was never ashore.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> she hesitated—<span class="tei tei-q">“but you said you were in the
Army.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Beveridge gave her a look full of benignant compassion
that made her, she did not quite know why, feel terribly
abashed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My regiment was quartered at sea,”</span> he condescended
to explain. <span class="tei tei-q">“But in time my conscience awoke. I
announced my intention of resuming my charge. My
uncle was furious. My enemies were many. I was
seized, thrown into this prison-house, and now my only
friend fails me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were both silent. She ventured once to glance
up at his face, and it seemed to her that his eyes were
moist—though perhaps it was that her own were a little
dim.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let us skate on,”</span> he said abruptly, with a fine air of
resignation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By the way,”</span> he suddenly added, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was extremely
High Church, in fact almost freezingly high.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For five minutes they skated in silence, then Lady
Alicia began softly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Supposing you—you went away&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is the use of talking of it?”</span> he exclaimed, melodramatically.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let me forget my short-lived hopes!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></span> a
friend,”</span> she said, slowly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A friend who tantalises me by <span class="tei tei-q">‘supposings’</span>!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But supposing you did, Mr Beveridge, would you
go back to your—did you say you had a parish?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg52" id="Pg52" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had: a large, populous, and happy parish. It is
my one dream to sit once more on its council and direct
my curate.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course that makes a difference. Mr Candles
didn’t know all this.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had come by this time to the corner of a little
island that lay not far from the shore; in the channel
ahead a board labelled <span class="tei tei-q">“Danger”</span> marked a hidden
spring; behind them the shining ice was almost bare of
skaters, for all but Dr Escott seemed to be leaving; on
the bank they could see Moggridge prowling about in
the gathering dusk, a vigilant reminder of captivity.
Mr Beveridge took the whole scene in with, it is to be
feared, a militant rather than an episcopal eye. Then
he suddenly asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you alone?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You drive back?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ye<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E2" id="E2" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e2" class="tei tei-ref">—</a></span>es.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took out his watch and made a brief calculation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go now, call at Clankwood or do anything else you
like, and pass down the drive again at a quarter to five.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sudden pinning of her irresolution almost took
Lady Alicia’s breath away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I never said&mdash;&mdash;”</span> she began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear friend,”</span> he interrupted, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the hour of
action only a fool ever says. Come on.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And while she still hesitated they were off again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But&mdash;&mdash;”</span> she tried to expostulate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dearest friend,”</span> he whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“and my dear
old vicarage!”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg53" id="Pg53" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He gave her no time to protest. Her skates were off,
she was on her way to her carriage, and he was striking
out again for the middle of the lake before she had time
to collect her wits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took out his watch and looked at the time. It
was nearly a quarter-past four. Then he came up to
Escott, who by this time was the only other soul on the ice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“About time we were going in,”</span> said Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Give me half-an-hour more. I’ll show you how to
do that vine you admired.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right,”</span> assented the doctor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A minute or two later Mr Beveridge, as if struck by
a sudden reflection, exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“By Jove, there’s that
poor devil Moggridge freezing to death on shore. Can’t
you manage to look after so dangerous a lunatic yourself?
It is his tea-time, too.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hallo, so he is,”</span> replied Escott; <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll
send him up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so there were only left the two men on the ice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a little the lesson went on, and presently, leaving
the doctor to practise, Mr Beveridge skated away by
himself. He first paused opposite a seat on the bank
over which hung Dr Escott’s great fur coat. This
spectacle appeared to afford him peculiar pleasure.
Then he looked at his watch. It was half-past four.
He shut the watch with a click, threw a glance at his
pupil, and struck out for the island. If the doctor had
been looking, he might have seen him round it in the
gloaming.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr Escott, leaning far on his outside edge, met him
as he returned.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg54" id="Pg54" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What’s that under your coat?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A picture I intend to ask your opinion on presently,”</span>
replied Mr Beveridge; and he added, with his most
charming air, <span class="tei tei-q">“But now, before we go in, let me give
you a ride on one of these chairs, doctor.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They started off, the pace growing faster and faster,
and presently Dr Escott saw that they were going behind
the island.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Look out for the spring!”</span> he cried.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It must be bearing now,”</span> replied Mr Beveridge,
striking out harder than ever; <span class="tei tei-q">“they have taken away
the board.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All right,”</span> said the doctor, <span class="tei tei-q">“on you go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke he felt a violent push, and the chair, slewing
round as it went, flew on its course unguided. Mr
Beveridge’s skates rasped on the ice with a spray of
white powder as he stopped himself suddenly. Ahead
of him there was a rending crack, and Dr Escott and his
chair disappeared. Mr Beveridge laughed cheerfully,
and taking from under his coat a board with the legend
<span class="tei tei-q">“Danger”</span> printed in large characters across its face,
he placed it beside the jagged hole.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here is the picture, doctor,”</span> he said, as a dripping,
gasping head came up for the second time. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must
ask a thousand pardons for this—shall I say, liberty?
But, as you know, I’m off my head. Good night. Let
me recommend a hot drink when you come out. There
are only five feet of water, so you won’t drown.”</span> And
with that he skated rapidly away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Escott had a glimpse of him vanishing round the corner
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg55" id="Pg55" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the island, and then the ice broke again, and down he
went. Four, five, six times he made a desperate effort
to get out, and every time the thin ice tore under his
hands, and he slipped back again. By the seventh
attempt he had broken his way to the thicker sheet; he
got one leg up, slipped, got it up again, and at last, half
numbed and wholly breathless, he was crawling circumspectly
away. When at last he ventured to rise to
his feet, he skated with all the speed he could make to
the seat where he had left his coat. A pair of skates
lay there instead, but the coat had vanished. Dr Escott’s
philosophical estimate of Mr Beveridge became considerably
modified.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank the Lord, he can’t get out of the grounds,”</span>
he said to himself; <span class="tei tei-q">“what a dangerous devil he is! But
he’ll be sorry for this performance, or I’m mistaken.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he arrived at the house his first inquiries were
for his tutor in the art of vine-cutting, and he was rather
surprised to hear that he had not yet returned, for he
only imagined himself the victim of a peculiarly ill-timed
practical joke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men with lanterns were sent out to search the park;
and still there was no sign of Mr Beveridge. Inquiries
were made at the lodge, but the gatekeeper could swear
that only a single carriage had passed through. Dr
Congleton refused at first to believe that he could possibly
have got out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Our arrangements are perfect,—the thing’s absurd,”</span>
he said, peremptorily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That there man, sir,”</span> replied Moggridge, who had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg56" id="Pg56" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been summoned, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the slipperiest customer as ever I
seed. ’E’s hout, sir, I believe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We might at least try the stations,”</span> suggested Escott,
who had by this time changed, and indulged in the hot
drink recommended.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor began to be a little shaken.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, well,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll send a man to each of the
three stations within walking distance; and whether he’s
out or in, we’ll have him by to-morrow morning. I’ve
always taken care that he had no money in his pockets.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what is a doctor’s care against a woman’s heart?
For many to-morrows Clankwood had to lament the loss
of the gifted Francis Beveridge.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sixteen minutes to five Mr Beveridge stood by the
side of the Clankwood Avenue, comfortably wrapped
in Dr Escort’s fur coat, and smoking with the greatest
relish one of Dr Escott’s undeniable cigars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was almost dark, the air bit keen, the dim park
with its population of black trees was filled with a frosty,
eager stillness. All round the invisible wall hemmed
him in, the ten pounds, seventeen shillings, and sixpence
lay useless in his pocket till that was past, and his one
hope depended on a woman. But Mr Beveridge was an
amateur in the sex, and he smiled complacently as he
smoked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had waited barely three minutes when the quick
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg57" id="Pg57" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
clatter of a pair of horses fell on his ears, and presently
the lights of a carriage and pair, driving swiftly away
from Clankwood, raked the drive on either side. As
they rattled up to him he gave a shout to the coachman
to stop, and stepped right in front of the horses. With
something that sounded unlike a blessing, the pair were
thrown almost on their haunches to check them in time.
Never stopping to explain, he threw open the door and
sprang in; the coachman, hearing no sound of protest,
whipped up again, and Mr Beveridge found himself
rolling through the park of Clankwood in the Countess
of Grillyer’s carriage with a very timid little figure by
his side. Even in that moment of triumphant excitement
the excellence of his manners was remarkable:
the first thing he said was, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mind smoking?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In her confusion of mind Lady Alicia could only reply
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no,”</span> and not till some time afterwards did she remember
that the odour of a cigar was clinging and the
Countess’s nose unusually sensitive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this first remark he leaned back in silence, gradually
filling the carriage with a blue-grey cloud, and looking
out of the windows first on one side and then on the
other. They passed quickly through the lines of trees
and the open spaces of frosty park-land, they drew up
at the lodge for a moment, he heard his prison gates
swing open, the harness jingled and the hoofs began to
clatter again, a swift vision of lighted windows and a
man looking on them incuriously swept by, and then they
were rolling over a country road between hedgerows and
under the free stars.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg58" id="Pg58" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the Lady Alicia who spoke first.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I never thought you would really come,”</span> she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have been waiting for that remark,”</span> he replied,
with his most irresistible smile; <span class="tei tei-q">“now for some more
practical conversation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he did not immediately begin this conversation himself,
her curiosity overcame her, and she asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“How
did you manage to get out?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As my friend Dr Escott offered no opposition, I
walked away.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Did he really let you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He never even expostulated.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then—then it’s all right?”</span> she said, with
an inexplicable sensation of disappointment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perfectly—so far.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But—didn’t they object?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not yet,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“objections to my movements
are generally made after they have been performed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somehow she felt immensely relieved at this hint of
opposition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m so glad you got away,”</span> she whispered, and then
repented in a flutter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not more so than I am,”</span> he answered, pressing her
hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to know how
near Ashditch Junction you propose to take me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where are you going to, Mr Beveridge?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr Beveridge”</span> was thrown in as a corrective
to the hand-pressure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To London; where else, my Alicia? With £10,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg59" id="Pg59" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
17s. 6d. in my pocket, I shall be able to eat at least three
good dinners, and, by the third of them, if I haven’t
fallen on my feet it will be the first time I have descended
so unluckily.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> she asked, considerably disconcerted, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
thought you were going back to your parish.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment he too seemed a trifle put about. Then
he replied readily, <span class="tei tei-q">“So I am, as soon as I have purchased
the necessary outfit, restocked my ecclesiastical library,
and called on my bishop.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She felt greatly relieved at this justification of her share
in the adventure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Drop me at the nearest point to the station,”</span> he
said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid,”</span> she began—<span class="tei tei-q">“I mean I think you had
better get out soon. The first road on the right will
take you straight there, and we had better not pass it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I must bid you farewell,”</span> and he sighed most
effectively. <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell, my benefactress, my dear Alicia!
Shall I ever see you, shall I ever hear of you again?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I might—I might just write once; if you will answer
it: I mean if you would care to hear from such a&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She found it difficult to finish, and prudently stopped.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks,”</span> he replied cheerfully; <span class="tei tei-q">“do,—I shall live in
hopes. I’d better stop the carriage now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He let down the window, when she said hastily, <span class="tei tei-q">“But
I don’t know your address.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He reflected for an instant. <span class="tei tei-q">“Care of the Archbishop
of York will always find me,”</span> he replied; and as if unwilling
to let his emotion be observed, he immediately
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg60" id="Pg60" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
put his head out of the window and called on the coachman
to stop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye,”</span> he whispered, tenderly, squeezing her
fingers with one hand and opening the door with the
other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t quite forget me,”</span> she whispered back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Never!”</span> he replied, and was in the act of getting
out when he suddenly turned, and exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I must
be more out of practice than I thought; I had almost
forgotten the protested salute.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And without further preamble the Lady Alicia found
herself kissed at last.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He jumped out and shut the door, and the carriage
with its faint halo clattered into the darkness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They are wonderfully alike,”</span> he reflected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About twenty minutes later he walked leisurely into
Ashditch Junction, and having singled out the station-master,
he accosted him with an air of beneficient consideration
and inquired how soon he could catch a train
for London.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appeared that the up express was not due for nearly
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A little too long to wait,”</span> he said to himself, as he
turned up the collar of his purloined fur coat to keep
out the cold, and picked another cigar from its rightful
owner’s case.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By way of further defying the temperature and cementing
his acquaintance with the station-master, he offered
to regale that gratified official with such refreshments as
the station bar provided. In the consumption of whiskies-and-sodas
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg61" id="Pg61" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(a beverage difficult to obtain in any
quantity at Clankwood) Mr Beveridge showed himself
as accomplished as in every other feat. In thirty-five
minutes he had despatched no fewer than six, besides
completely winning the station-master’s heart. As he
had little more than five minutes now to wait, he bade a
genial farewell to the lady behind the bar, and started
to purchase his ticket.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly had he left the door of the refreshment-room
when he perceived an uncomfortably familiar figure just
arrived, breathless with running, on the opposite platform.
The light of a lamp fell on his shining face: it
was Moggridge!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A stout heart might be forgiven for sinking at the sight,
but Mr Beveridge merely turned to his now firm friends
and said with his easiest air, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the opposite platform I
perceive one of my runaway lunatics. Bring a couple
of stout porters as quickly as you can, for he is a person
of much strength and address. My name,”</span> he drew a
card-case from the pocket of his fur coat, <span class="tei tei-q">“is, as you see,
Dr Escott of Clankwood.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile Moggridge, after hurriedly investigating
the platform he was on, suddenly spied a tall fur-coated
figure on the opposite side. Without a moment’s hesitation
he sprang on to the rails, and had just mounted the
other side as the station-master and two porters appeared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing his allies by his side Mr Beveridge never said a
word, but, throwing off his hat, he lowered his head,
charged his keeper, and picking him up by the knees
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg62" id="Pg62" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
threw him heavily on his back. Before he had a chance
of recovering himself the other three were seated on his
chest employed in winding a coil of rope round and round
his prostrate form.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two minutes later Moggridge was sitting bound hand
and foot in the booking office, addressing an amused audience
in a strain of perhaps excusable exasperation,
which however merely served to impress the Ashditch
officials with a growing sense of their address in capturing
so dangerous a lunatic. In the middle of this entertaining
scene the London express steamed in, and Mr
Beveridge, courteously thanking the station-master for
his assistance, stepped into a first-class carriage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should be much obliged,”</span> he said, leaning on the
door of his compartment and blowing the smoke of Dr
Escott’s last Havannah lightly from his lips, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you
would be kind enough to keep that poor fellow in the
station till to-morrow. It is rather too late to send him
back now. Good night, and many thanks.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pressed a coin into the station-master’s hand,
which that
<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E3" id="E3" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e3" class="tei tei-ref">disappointed</a></span>
official only discovered on emptying
his pockets at night to be an ordinary sixpence, the
guard whistled, and one by one, smoothly and slowly
and then in a bright stream, the station lamps slipped
by. The last of them flitted into the night, and the
train swung and rattled by a mile a minute nearer to
London town and farther from the high stone wall.
There was no other stop, and for a long hour the adventurer
sat with his legs luxuriously stretched along the
cushions looking out into a fainter duplicate of his carriage,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg63" id="Pg63" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pierced now and then by the glitter of brighter
points as they whisked by some wayside village, or crossed
by the black shadows of trees. The whole time he
smiled contentedly, doubtless at the prospect of his parish
work. All at once he seemed stirred, and, turning in
his seat, laid his face upon the window, and pulled down
the blind behind his head, so that he could see into the
night. He had spied the first bright filaments of London.
Quickly they spread into a twinkling network, and then
as quickly were shut out by the first line of suburb houses;
through the gaps they grew nearer and flared cheerfully;
the train hooted over an archway, and in the road below
he had a glimpse of shop windows and crowded pavements
and moving omnibuses: he was in the world again,
and at the foretaste of all this life he laughed like a delighted
child. Last of all came the spread of shining
rails and the red and yellow lights of many signals, and
then the high glass roof and long lamp-lit platforms of
St Euston’s Cross.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unencumbered by luggage or plans, Mr Francis Beveridge
stuck his hands deep in his pockets and strolled
aimlessly enough out of the station into the tideway of
the Euston Road. For a little he stood stock-still on the
pavement watching the throng of people and the perpetual
buses and drays and the jingling hansoms picking
their way through it all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For a man of brains,”</span> he moralised, <span class="tei tei-q">“even though
he be certified as insane, for probably the best of reasons,
this London has surely fools enough to provide him with
all he needs and more than he deserves. I shall set out
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg64" id="Pg64" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with my lantern like a second Diogenes to look for a
foolish man.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so he strolled along again to the first opening
southwards. That led him through a region of dingy
enough brick by day, but decked now with its string of
lamps and bright shop-windows here and there, and kept
alive by passing buses and cabs going and coming from
the station. Farther on the street grew gloomier, and a
dark square with a grove of trees in the middle opened
off one side; but, rattle or quiet, flaring shops or sad-looking
lodgings, he found it all too fresh and amusing
to hurry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Back to my parish again,”</span> he said to himself, smiling
broadly at the drollery of the idea. <span class="tei tei-q">“If I’m caught
to-morrow, I’ll at least have one merry night in my
wicked, humorous old charge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He reached Holborn and turned west in the happiest
and most enviable of moods; the very policemen seemed
to cast a friendly eye on him; the frosty air, he thought,
made the lights burn brighter and the crowd move more
briskly than ever he had seen them. Suddenly the sight
of a hairdresser’s saloon brought an inspiration. He
stroked his beard, twisted his moustaches half regretfully,
and then exclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“Exit Mr Beveridge,”</span> turned
into the shop.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron Rudolf von Blitzenberg sat by himself
at a table in the dining-room of the Hôtel
Mayonaise, which, as everybody knows, is the
largest and most expensive in London. He
was a young man of a florid and burly Teutonic type
and the most ingenuous countenance. Being possessed
of a curious and enterprising disposition, as well as
the most ample means, he had left his ancestral castle in
Bavaria to study for a few months the customs and
politics of England. In the language he was already
proficient, and he had promised himself an amusing as
well as an instructive visit. But, although he had only
arrived in London that morning, he was already beginning
to feel an uncomfortable apprehension lest in both respects
he should be disappointed. Though his introductions
were the best with which the British Ambassador
could supply him, they were only three or four in
number,—for, not wishing to be hampered with too many
acquaintances, he had rather chosen quality than quantity:
and now, in the course of the afternoon, he had
found to his chagrin that in every case the families were
out of town. In fact, so far as he could learn, they were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg66" id="Pg66" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not even at their own country seats. One was abroad,
another gone to the seaside to recover from the mumps,
or a third paying a round of visits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disappointment was sharp, he felt utterly at sea
as to what he should do, and he was already beginning to
experience the loneliness of a single mortal in a crowded
hotel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the frosty evening was setting in and the shops were
being lit, he had strolled out into the streets in the vague
hope of meeting some strange foreign adventure, or perhaps
even happily lighting upon some half-forgotten
diplomatic acquaintance. But he found the pavements
crowded with a throng who took no notice of him at all,
but seemed every man and most women of them to be
pushing steadily, and generally silently, towards a million
mysterious goals. Not that he could tell they were silent
except by their set lips, for the noise of wheels and horses
on so many hundreds of miles of streets, and the cries of
busmen and vendors of evening papers, made such a
hubbub that he felt before long in a maze. He lost his
way four times, and was patronisingly set right by beneficent
policemen; and at last, feeling like a man who has
fallen off a precipice on to a soft place—none the worse
but quite bewildered—he struggled back to his hotel.
There he spun out his time by watching the people come
and go, and at last dressed with extra deliberation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About eight o’clock he sat down to his solitary dinner.
The great gilt and panelled room was full of diners and
bustling waiters, but there was not a face the Baron had
ever seen before. He was just finishing a plate of whitebait
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg67" id="Pg67" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when he observed a stranger enter the room and
stroll in a very self-possessed manner down the middle,
glancing at the tables round him as though he was looking
either for a friend or a desirable seat. This gentleman
was tall, fair, and clean-shaved; he was dressed in a suit
of well-fitting tweeds, and his air impressed the Baron
as being natural and yet distinguished. At last his eye
fell upon the Baron, who felt conscious of undergoing a
quick, critical scrutiny. The table at which that nobleman
sat was laid for two, and coming apparently to a
sudden resolution, the good-looking stranger seated himself
in the vacant chair. In an agreeable voice and with
an unmistakably well-bred air he asked a waiter for the
wine-list, and then, like a man with an excellent appetite,
fell to upon the various <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hors
d’œuvres</span></span>, the entire collection
of which, in fact, he consumed in a wonderfully
short space of time. The Baron, being himself no trifler
with his victuals, regarded this feat with sympathetic
approval, and began to feel a little less alone in the world.
His naturally open disposition was warmed besides,
owing to a slight misconception he had fallen into, perfectly
excusable however in a foreigner. He thought he
had read somewhere that port was the usual accompaniment
to the first courses of an English dinner, and as
his waiter had been somewhat dilatory in bringing him
the more substantial items of the repast, he had already
drunk three claret-glasses of this cheering wine. The
chill recollections of his sixteen quarterings and the
exclusiveness he had determined to maintain as becoming
to his rank were already melting, and he met the stranger’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg68" id="Pg68" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eye with what for the life of him he could not help being a
cordial look.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis-à-vis</span></span> caught
the glance, smiled back, and immediately
asked, with the most charming politeness,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you care, sir, to split a bottle of champagne?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To—er—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shplid?</span></span>”</span> said the Baron,
with a disappointed consciousness of having been put at a loss
in his English by the very first man who had spoken to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon,—I am afraid I was unintelligibly
idiomatic. To divide, I should say, you consuming
one-half, I the other. Am I clear, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment the Baron was a little taken aback, and
then recollecting that the dining habits of the English
were still new to him, he concluded that the suggestion
was probably a customary act of courtesy. He had
already come to the conclusion that the gentleman must
be a person of rank, and he replied affably, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yah—zat
is, vid pleasure. Zanks, very.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The pleasure is mine,”</span> said the stranger—<span class="tei tei-q">“and half
the bottle,”</span> he added, smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron, whose perception of humour had been
abnormally increased by this time, laughed hilariously
at the infection of his new acquaintance’s smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot, goot!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, yah, zo.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Am I right, sir, in supposing that, despite the perfection
of your English accent, I cannot be fortunate
enough to claim you as a countryman?”</span> asked the
stranger.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron’s resolutions of reticence had vanished
altogether before such unexpected and (he could not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg69" id="Pg69" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but think) un-English friendliness. He unburdened his
heart with a rush.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have ze right. I am Deutsch. I have gom to
England zis day for to lairn and to amuse myself. But
mein, vat you call?—introdogtions zey are not inside,
zat is zey are from off. Not von, all, every single gone
to ze gontry or to abroad. I am alone, I eat my dinner
in zolitude, I am pleased to meet you, sare.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cork popped and the champagne frothed into the
stranger’s glass. Raising it to his lips, he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Prosit!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Prosit!”</span> responded the Baron, enthusiastically. <span class="tei tei-q">“You
know ze Deutsch, sare?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am safer in English, I confess.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, das ist goot, I vant for to practeese. Ve vill
talk English.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With all my heart,”</span> said the stranger. <span class="tei tei-q">“I, too, am
alone, and I hold myself more than fortunate in making
your acquaintance. It’s a devilish dull world when one
can’t share a bottle—or a brace of them, for the matter
of that.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You know London?”</span> asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I used to, and I daresay my memory will revive.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know it not, pairhaps you can inform. I haf gom,
as I say, to-day.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With pleasure,”</span> said the stranger, readily. <span class="tei tei-q">“In fact,
if you are ever disengaged I may possibly be able to act as
showman.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Showman!”</span> roared the Baron, thinking he had discovered
a jest. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha! Goot, zehr goot!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other looked a trifle astonished for an instant,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg70" id="Pg70" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and then as he sipped his champagne an expression of
intense satisfaction came over his face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can put away my lantern,”</span> he said to himself,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I
have found him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I have the boldness to ask your name, sir?”</span> he
asked aloud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg,”</span> that nobleman
replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yours, sare—may I dare?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Francis Bunker, at your service, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are noble?”</span> queried the Baron a little anxiously,
for his prejudices on this point were strong.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“According to your standard I believe I may say so.
That’s to say, my family have borne arms for two hundred
odd generations; twenty-five per cent of them have died
of good living; and the most malicious have never accused
us of brains. I myself may not be very typical,
but I assure you it isn’t my ancestors’ fault.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter part of this explanation entirely puzzled
the Baron. The first statement, though eminently satisfactory,
was also a little bewildering.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two hondred generations?”</span> he asked, courteously.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Zat is a vary old family. All bore arms you say, Mistair
Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, gravely. <span class="tei tei-q">“The first few
bore tails as well.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> laughed the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are a fonny
man I pairceive, vat you call clown, yes?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What my friends call clown, and I call wit,”</span> Mr
Bunker corrected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vit! Ha, ha, ha!”</span> roared the Baron, whose mind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg71" id="Pg71" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was now in an El Dorado of humour when jokes grew
like daisies. His loneliness had disappeared as if by
magic; as course succeeded course his contentment showed
itself in a perpetually beaming smile: he ceased to worry
even about his friend’s pedigree, convinced in his mind
that manners so delightful and distinguished could only
result from repeated quarterings and unoccupied forefathers.
Yet by the time dessert arrived and he had
again returned to his port, he began to feel an extreme
curiosity to know more concerning Mr Bunker. He
himself had volunteered a large quantity of miscellaneous
information: about Bavaria, its customs and its people,
more especially the habits and history of the Blitzenberg
family; about himself, his parentage and education; all
about his family ghost, his official position as hereditary
carpet-beater to the Bavarian Court, and many other
things equally entertaining and instructive. Mr Bunker,
for his part, had so far confined his confidences to his
name.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Bonker,”</span> said the Baron at last—he had
become quite familiar by this time—<span class="tei tei-q">“vat make you in
London? I fear you are bird of passage. Do you stay
long?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker cracked a nut, looking very serious; then
he leant on one elbow, glanced up at the ceiling pensively,
and sighed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hope I do not ask vat I should not,”</span> the Baron
interposed, courteously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, ask what you like,”</span> replied Mr
Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“In a city full of strangers, or of friends who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg72" id="Pg72" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have forgotten me, you alone have my confidence. My
story is a common one of youthful folly and present
repentance, but such as it is, you are welcome to it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron gulped down half a glass of port and leaned
forward sympathetically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My father,”</span> Mr Bunker continued with an air of
half-sad reminiscence, <span class="tei tei-q">“is one of the largest landowners
and the head of one of the most ancient families in the
north of England. I was his eldest son and heir. I am
still, I have every reason to believe, his eldest son, but
my heirship, I regret to say, is more doubtful. I spent
a prodigal youth and a larger sum of money than my
poor father approved of. He was a strict though a kind
parent, and for the good of my health and the replenishment
of the family coffers, which had been sadly drained
by my extravagance, he sent me abroad. There I have
led a roving life for the last six years, and at last, my wild
oats sown, reaped, and gathered in (and a well-filled stackyard
they made, I can assure you), I decided to return to
England and become an ornament to respectable society.
Like you, I arrived in London to-day, but only to find
to my disgust that my family have gone to winter in
Egypt. So you see that at present I am like a shipwrecked
sailor clinging to a rock and waiting, with what
patience I can muster, for a boat to take me off.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You mean,”</span> inquired the Baron, anxiously, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
you vish to go to Egypt at vonce?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had thought of it; though there is a difficulty in the
way, I admit.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You vill not stay zen here?”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg73" id="Pg73" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, why should I? I have neither
friends nor&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not like to zink I shall lose your company so
soon.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I admit,”</span> allowed Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“that this fortunate
meeting tempts me to stay.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vy not?”</span> said the Baron, cordially. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can your
fader not vait to see you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I hardly think he will worry about me, I confess.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zen stay, my goot Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Unfortunately there is the same difficulty as stands
in the way of my going to Egypt.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And may I inquire vat zat is?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To tell you the truth,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, with an
air of reluctant candour, <span class="tei tei-q">“my funds are rather low. I
had trusted to finding my father at home, but as he
isn’t, why&mdash;&mdash;”</span> he shrugged his shoulders and threw
himself back in his chair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron seemed struck with an idea which he hesitated
to express.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shall we smoke?”</span> his friend suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vaiter!”</span> cried the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“bring here two best cigars
and two coffee!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A liqueur, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, yah. Vat for you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A liqueur brandy suggests itself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vaiter! and two brandy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> said the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“I haf an idea, Bonker.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg, as I have said,
had a warm heart. He was, besides, alone in one hundred
and twenty square miles of strangers and foreigners
when he had happened upon this congenial spirit. He
began in a tone of the most ingenuous friendliness—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I haf no friends here. My introdogtions zey are
gone. Bot I haf moch money, and I vish a, vat you
say?—showman, ha, ha, ha! You haf too leetle money
and no friends and you can show. You show and I
will loan you vat you vish. May I dare to suggest?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My goot Bonker! I am in airnest, I assure. Vy not?
It is vun gentleman and anozzer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are far too kind.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is to myself I am kind, zen. I vant a guide, a
frient. It is a loan. Do not scruple. Ven your fader
goms you can pay if you please. It is nozing to me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, my dear Baron,”</span> said Mr Bunker, like a man
persuaded against his will, <span class="tei tei-q">“what can I say? I confess
I might find a little difficulty in replenishing my purse
without resorting to disagreeable means, and if you really
wish my society, why&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zen it is a bairgain?”</span> cried the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you insist&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I insist. Vaiter! Alzo two ozzer liqueur. Ve most
drink to ze bairgain, Bonker.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They pledged each other cordially, and talked from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg75" id="Pg75" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that moment like old friends. The Baron was thoroughly
pleased with himself, and Mr Bunker seemed
no less gratified at his own good fortune. Half an hour
went quickly by, and then the Baron exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us
do zomzing to-night, Bonker. I burn for to begin zis
show of London.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What would you care to do, Baron? It is rather
late, I am afraid, to think of a theatre. What do you say
to a music-hall?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Music-hall? I haf seen zem at home. Damned
amusing, das ist ze expression, yes?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a perfect description.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot,”</span> continued the Baron, solemnly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I must not
begin vid ze vickedest.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And yet,”</span> replied his friend, persuasively, <span class="tei tei-q">“even
wickedness needs a beginning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot, if I begin I may not stop. Zomzing more qviet
ze first night. Haf you a club?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker pondered for a moment, and a curious
smile stole across his face. Then it vanished, and he
answered readily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, Baron, an excellent idea.
I haven’t been to my club for so long that it never struck
me. Let us come.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot!”</span> cried the Baron, rising with alacrity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They put on their coats (Mr Bunker’s, it may be remarked,
being a handsome fur-lined garment), the porter
hailed a cab, and the driver was ordered to take them
to the Regent’s Club in Pall Mall. The Baron knew it
by reputation as the most exclusive in London, and his
opinion of his friend rose still higher.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg76" id="Pg76" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They joined a jingling string of other hansoms and
sped swiftly through the exhilarating bustle of the streets.
To the Baron it seemed as if a great change had come
over the city since he wandered disconsolately before
dinner. Carried swiftly to the music of the little bells
through the sharp air and the London night that is brighter
than day, with a friend by his side and a good dinner
within, he marked the most astonishing difference. All
the people seemed to talk and laugh, and for his own
part he found it hard to keep his tongue still.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know ze name of ze Regent’s,”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“vun club
of ze best, is it not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The very best club, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zey are all noble?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In many cases the receipts for their escutcheons are
still in their pockets.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the precise significance of this explanation
was not quite clear to the Baron, it sounded eminently
satisfactory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zo?”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be moch interested to see
zem.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they entered the club the porter stared at them
curiously, and even made a movement as though he
would step out and address them; but Mr Bunker, wishing
him a courteous good evening, walked briskly up to
the hat-and-cloak racks in the hall. A young man had
just hung up his hat, and as he was divesting himself of
his coat, Mr Bunker quickly took the hat down, glanced
at the name inside, and replaced it on its peg. Then he
held out his hand and addressed the young man cordially.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg77" id="Pg77" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening, Transome, how are you?”</span> said he,
and, heedless of the look of surprise on the other’s face,
he turned towards the Baron and added, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me introduce
the Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg—Mr Transome.
The Baron has just come to England, and I
thought he couldn’t begin better than by a visit to the
Regent’s. Let us come into the smoking-room.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a few minutes they were all on the best of terms.
A certain perplexity, and almost shyness, that the young
man showed at first, vanished rapidly before the Baron’s
cordiality and Mr Bunker’s well-bred charm of manner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were deeply engrossed in a discussion on the
reigning sovereign of the Baron’s native land, a monarch
of whose enlightened policy that nobleman spoke with
pardonable pride, when two elderly gentlemen entered
the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are these?”</span> Mr Bunker whispered to Transome.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I know them very well, but I am always bad at names.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lord Fabrigas and General M’Dermott,”</span> replied
Transome.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly Mr Bunker rose and greeted the new-comers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good evening, Lord Fabrigas; good evening, General.
You have just come in time to be introduced to the Baron
Rudolph von Blitzenberg, whom you doubtless know
by reputation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron rose and bowed, and it struck him that
elderly English gentlemen were singularly stiff and constrained
in their manner. Mr Bunker, however, continued
cheerfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are just going to have a smoking
concert. Will you begin, Baron?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg78" id="Pg78" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know not English songs,”</span> replied the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“bot
I should like moch to hear.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must join in the chorus, then.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, Bonker. I haf a voice zat is considered—vat
you call—deafening, yes?—in ze chorus.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker cleared his throat, and, just as the General
was on the point of interposing a remark, struck up
hastily; and for the first time in its long and honourable
history the smoking-room of the Regent’s Club reechoed
to a popular music-hall ditty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid,”</span> said Mr Bunker, as they finished the
chorus, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I can’t remember any more. Now, General,
it’s your turn.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> replied that gallant officer, who had listened
to this ditty in purple and petrified astonishment, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
don’t know who the devil you are, but I can tell you, you
won’t remain a member of this club much longer if you
come into it again in this state.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had forgotten,”</span> said Mr Bunker, with even more
than his usual politeness, <span class="tei tei-q">“that such an admirable music-hall
critic was listening to me. I must apologise for my
poor effort.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wishing him courteously good-night, he took the Baron
by the arm and walked out. While that somewhat perplexed
nobleman was struggling into his coat, his friend
rapidly and dexterously converted all the silk hats he
could see into the condition of collapsed opera hats,
and then picked a small hand-bag off the floor. The
Baron walked out through the door first, but Mr Bunker
stopped for an instant opposite the hall-porter’s box,
and crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Good night to you, sir!”</span> hurled the bag
through the glass, rushed after his friend, and in less
time than it takes to tell they were tearing up Pall Mall
in a hansom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a few minutes both were silent; then the Baron
said slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not qvite onderstand.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron,”</span> his friend explained gaily, <span class="tei tei-q">“these
practical jokes are very common in our clubs. They
are quite part of our national life, you know, and I
thought you ought to see everything.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron said nothing, but he began to realise that
he was indeed in a foreign country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vell, Bonker, vat show to-day?”</span> said the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker sipped his coffee and smiled back at his
friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What would you like?”</span> said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were sitting in the Baron’s private room finishing
one of the renowned Hôtel Mayonaise breakfasts. Out
of the windows they could see the bright curving river,
the bare tops of the Embankment trees, a file of barges
drifting with the tide, and cold-looking clouds hurrying
over the chaos of brick on the opposite shore. It was a
bright breezy morning, and the Baron felt in high good-humour
with his surroundings. On maturer consideration,
the entertaining experience of the night before had
greatly raised Mr Bunker in his estimation. He had
chuckled his way through a substantial breakfast, and in
such good company felt ready for any adventure that
might turn up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He lit a cigar, pushed back his chair, and replied
blandly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am in your hands. I am ready to enjoy
anyzing.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you wish instruction or entertainment?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mix zem, Bonker. Entertain by instrogtion; instrogt
by entertaining.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are epigrammatic, Baron, but devilish vague. I
presume, however, that you wish entertaining experience
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg81" id="Pg81" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from which a man of your philosophical temperament
can draw a moral—afterwards.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha!”</span> laughed the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Excellent! You provide
ze experiences—I draw ze moral.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And we share the entertainment. The theory is
perfect, but I’m afraid we need a programme. Now, on
my own first visit to London I remember being taken—by
the hand—to Madame Tussaud’s Waxworks, the Tower,
St Paul’s Cathedral, the fishmarket at Billingsgate, the
British Museum, and a number of other damnably edifying
spectacles. You might naturally suppose that after
such a round it would be quite superfluous for me ever to
come up to town again. Yet, surprising as it may appear,
most of the knowledge of London I hope to put at
your disposal has been gained in the course of subsequent
visits.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot zese places—Tousaud, Tower,
Paul’s—are zey not instrogtif?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you wish to learn that a great number of years
ago a vast quantity of inconsequent events occurred, or
that in an otherwise amusing enough world there are
here and there collected so many roomfuls of cheerless
articles, I can strongly recommend a visit to the Tower of
London or the British Museum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In mine own gontry,”</span> said the Baron, thoughtfully,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I can lairn zo moch.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, my dear Baron, while you are here forget it
all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And yet,”</span> said the Baron, still thoughtfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“somzing
I should lairn here.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg82" id="Pg82" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly; you will learn something of what goes on
underneath a waistcoat and a little of the contents of a
corset and petticoat. Also of the strange customs of this
city and the excellence of British institutions.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> laughed the Baron, who thought that if
his friend had not actually made a jest, it was at least
time for one to occur. <span class="tei tei-q">“I see, I see. I draw ze moral,
ha, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This morning,”</span> Mr Bunker continued, reflectively,
<span class="tei tei-q">“we might—let me see—well, we might do a little
shopping. To tell you the truth, Baron, my South African
experiences have somewhat exhausted my wardrobe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, zo. Cairtainly ve vill shop. Bot, Bonker,
Soud Africa? Vas it not Soud America?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Did I say Africa? America of course I meant.
Well, let us shop if you have no objections: then we might
have a little lunch, and afterwards visit the Park. For
the evening, what do you say to a theatre?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot!”</span> cried the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Make it tzos.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker’s shopping turned out to be a pretty extensive
operation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Loan vat you please of money,”</span> said his friend. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
gentleman should be dressed in agreement.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With now and then an apology for his extravagance,
he took full advantage of the Baron’s generosity, and
ordered such an assortment of garments that his tailor
could hardly bow low enough to express his gratification.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After an excellent lunch in the most expensive restaurant
to be found, they walked arm-in-arm westwards along
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg83" id="Pg83" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Piccadilly, Mr Bunker pointing out the various objects
of historical or ephemeral interest to be seen in that
thoroughfare, the Baron drinking in this information
with the serious air of the distinguished traveller.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now we come to the Park,”</span> said Mr Bunker.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Guard your heart, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> replied the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Zo instrogtion is
feenished, and now goms entertainment, ha?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With the moral always running through it, remember.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not forget.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sunshine had brought out a great many carriages
and a sprinkling of walkers along the railings. The two
friends strolled among them, eyeing the women and
stopping now and then to look back at a carriage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose,”</span> said the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“zat vile you haf been
avay your frients have forgot you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke a young man looked hard at Mr Bunker,
and even made a movement as though he would stop
and speak to him. Mr Bunker looked blandly through
him and walked on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not know zat gentleman?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Which gentleman?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze young man zat looked so at you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Some young men have a way of staring here, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few minutes later a lady in a passing carriage looked
round sharply at them with an air of great surprise, and
half bowed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> exclaimed the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“zat vas a frient of
yours!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am not a friend of hers, then,”</span> Mr Bunker replied
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg84" id="Pg84" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with a laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“Her bow I think must have been aimed
at you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron shook his head, and seemed to be drawing
a moral.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Baron,”</span> his friend exclaimed, suddenly, <span class="tei tei-q">“let us go
back; here comes one of our most popular phenomena,
a London fog. We need not stay in the Park to observe
it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was already obscured; there stole a most
insidious chill through the air; like the changing of a
scene on the stage they found themselves in a few minutes
walking in a little ring of trees and road and iron railings
instead of a wide sunny park; the roar of the streets came
from behind a wall of mist that opened mysteriously to let
a phantom carriage in and out, and closed silently behind
it again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I like not zis,”</span> said the Baron, with a shiver.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the time they had found Piccadilly again there was
nothing at all to be seen but the light of the nearest lamp,
as large and far away as a struggling sun, and the shadowy
people who flitted by.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their talk ceased. The Baron turned up his collar
and sucked his cigar lugubriously, and Mr Bunker
seemed unusually thoughtful. They had walked nearly
as far as Piccadilly Circus when they were pulled up by a
cab turning down a side-street. There was a lamp-post
at the corner, and under it stood a burly man, his red
face quite visible as they came up to his shoulder.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an instant Mr Bunker seized the Baron by the arm,
pulled him round, and began to walk hastily back again.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg85" id="Pg85" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat for zis?”</span> said the Baron, in great astonishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We have come too far, thanks to this infernal fog.
We must cross the street and take the first turning on the
other side. I must apologise, Baron, for my absence of
mind.”</span></p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cab passed by and the red-faced man strolled on.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Like lookin’ for a needle in a bloomin’
haystack,”</span> he said to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“I might as well go back
to Clankwood. ’E’s a good riddance, I say.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron and Mr Bunker discussed their dinner
with the relish of approving connoisseurs. Mr Bunker
commended the hock, and suggested a second bottle;
the Baron praised the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">entrées</span></span>, and insisted on another
helping. The frequent laughter arising from their table
excited general remark throughout the room, and already
the waiters were whispering to the other guests that this
was a German nobleman of royal blood engaged in a
diplomatic mission of importance, and his friend a ducal
member of the English Cabinet, at present, for reasons
of state, incognito.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker!”</span> exclaimed the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am in zat frame
of head I vant a romance, an adventure”</span> (lowering his
voice a little), <span class="tei tei-q">“mit a beautiful lady, Bonker.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It must be a romance, Baron?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg86" id="Pg86" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A novel, a story to tell to mine frients. In a strange
city man expects strange zings.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I’ll do my best for you, but I confess the provision
of romantic adventures is a little outside the programme
we’ve arranged.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha! Ve shall see, ve shall see, Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They arrived at the Corinthian Theatre about the
middle of the first act, for, as Mr Bunker explained, it
is always well to produce a good first impression, and
few more effective means can be devised than working
one’s way to the middle of a line of stalls with the play
already in progress.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hardly were they seated when the Baron drove his
elbow into his friend’s ribs (draped for the night, it may
be remarked, with one of the Baron’s spare dress-coats)
and exclaimed in an excited whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“Next to you,
Bonker! Ach, zehr hüpsch!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even before this hint Mr Bunker had observed that
the lady on the other side of him was possessed of exceptional
attractions. For a little time he studied her
out of the corners of his eyes. He noticed that the stall
on the farther side of her was empty, that she once or
twice looked round as though she expected somebody,
and that she seemed not altogether unconscious of her
new neighbours. He further observed that her face
was of a type that is more usually engaged in attack than
defence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you like to know her?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, yah!”</span> replied the Baron, eagerly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bot—can
you?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg87" id="Pg87" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker smiled confidently. A few minutes later
he happened to let his programme fall into her lap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon,”</span> he whispered, softly, and glanced
into her eyes with a smile ready.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His usual discernment had not failed him. She
smiled, and instantly he produced his.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little later her opera-glasses happened to slip from
her hand, and though they only slipped slowly, it was no
doubt owing to his ready presence of mind that their fall
was averted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This time their fingers happened to touch, and they
smiled without an apology.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He leant towards her, looking, however, at the play.
They shared a laugh over a joke that she might have
been excused for not understanding; presently a criticism
of some situation escaped him inadvertently, and she
smiled again; soon after she gave an exclamation and he
answered sympathetically, and at the end of the act the
curtain came down on an acquaintance already begun.
As the lights were turned up, and here and there men
began to go out, she again looked at the entrances in
some apparent concern, either lest some one should not
come in or lest some one should.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He is late,”</span> said Mr Bunker, smiling.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She gave a very enticing look of surprise, and consented
to smile back before she coyly looked away again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“An erring husband, I presume.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She admitted that it was in fact a husband who had
failed her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> she added, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’m
afraid—I mean I expect he’ll
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg88" id="Pg88" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
come in after the next act. It’s so tiresome of him to
disappoint me like this.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker expressed the deepest sympathy with her
unfortunate predicament.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He has his ticket, of course?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it seemed that she had both the tickets with her,
an arrangement which he immediately denounced as
likely to lead to difficulties when her husband arrived.
He further, in the most obliging manner, suggested that
he should take the ticket for the other seat to the booking
office and leave instructions for its being given to the
gentleman on his arrival. The lady gave him a curious
little glance that seemed to imply a mixture of doubt as
to his motives with confidence in his abilities, and then
with many thanks agreed to his suggestion. Mr Bunker
took the ticket and rose at once.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That I may be sure you are in good company while I
am away,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“permit me to introduce my friend
the Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the Baron promptly took his vacant seat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On his return Mr Bunker found his friend wreathed
in smiles and engaged in the most animated conversation
with the lady, and before the last act was over, he gathered
from such scraps of conversation as reached his ears that
Rudolph von Blitzenberg had little to learn in one department
of a nobleman’s duties.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder where my husband can be,”</span> the lady
whispered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, heed him not, fair lady,”</span> replied the Baron.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Am I not instead of a hosband?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg89" id="Pg89" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m afraid you’re a very naughty man, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ven I am viz you,”</span> the gallant Baron answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
forget myself all bot your charms.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These advances being made in the most dulcet tones
of which the nobleman was master, and accompanied
by the most enamoured expression, it is not surprising
that the lady permitted herself to listen to them with
perhaps too ready an ear. What Mr Bunker’s arrangement
with the booking clerk had been was never quite
clear, but certainly the erring husband failed to make
his appearance at all, and at the last fall of the curtain
she was easily persuaded to let the Baron escort her home.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know I ought not, but if a husband deserts one so
faithlessly, what can I do?”</span> she said, with a very becoming
little shrug of her shoulders and a captivating lift
of her eyebrows.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, vat indeed? He desairves not so fair a consort.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But won’t it be troubling you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Trouble? Pleasure and captivation!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Excuse me, Baron,”</span> said the voice of Mr Bunker at
his elbow; <span class="tei tei-q">“if you will wait here at the door I shall send
up a cab.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot!”</span> cried the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“a zouzand zanks!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I myself,”</span> added Mr Bunker, with a profound bow
to the lady, <span class="tei tei-q">“shall say good night now. The best of
luck, Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a few minutes a hansom drove up, and the Baron,
springing in beside his charge, told the man to drive to
602 Eaton Square.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not too qvickly!”</span> he added, in a stage aside.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg90" id="Pg90" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They reached Trafalgar Square, matters inside going
harmoniously as a marriage bell,—almost, in fact, too
much suggesting that simile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why are we going down Whitehall?”</span> the lady exclaimed,
suddenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I know not,”</span> replied the Baron, placidly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ask him where he is going!”</span> she said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron, as in duty bound, asked, and the reassuring
reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“All right, sir,”</span> came back through the hole in the
roof.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I seem to know that man’s voice,”</span> the lady said.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He must have driven me before.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To me all ze English speak ze same,”</span> replied the
Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“All bot you, my fairest, viz your sound like
a—vat you call?—fiddle, is it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though his charmer had serious misgivings regarding
their cabman’s topographical knowledge, the Baron’s
company proved so absorbing that it was not till they
were being rapidly driven over Vauxhall Bridge that she
at last took alarm. At first the Baron strove to soothe
her by the most approved Teutonic blandishments, but
in time he too began to feel concerned, and in a voice
like thunder he repeatedly called upon the driver to stop.
No reply was vouchsafed, and the pace merely grew the
more reckless.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can’t you catch the reins?”</span> cried the lady, who had
got into a terrible fright.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron twice essayed the feat, but each time a
heavy blow over the knuckles from the butt-end of the
whip forced him to desist. The lady burst into tears.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg91" id="Pg91" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Baron swore in five languages alternately, and still
the cab pursued its headlong career through deserted
midnight streets, past infrequent policemen and stray
belated revellers, on into an unknown wilderness of
brick.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, don’t let him murder me!”</span> sobbed the lady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Haf cheer, fairest; he shall not vile I am viz you! Gott
in himmel, ze rascal! Parbleu und blood! Goddam!
Vait till I catch him, hell and blitzen! Haf courage,
dear!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh dear, oh dear!”</span> wailed the lady. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
shall <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></span>
do it again!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They must have covered miles, and still the speed
never abated, when suddenly, as they were rounding a
sharp corner, the horse slipped on the frost-bound road,
and in the twinkling of an eye the Baron and the lady
were sitting on opposite sides of their fallen steed, and
the cabman was rubbing his head some yards in front.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Teufel!”</span> exclaimed the Baron, rising carefully to
his feet. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, mine dearest vun, art thou hurt?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady was silent for a moment, as though trying
to decide, and then she burst into hysterical laughter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, zo,”</span> said the Baron, much relieved, <span class="tei tei-q">“zen vill I
see ze cabman.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That individual was still rubbing his head with a rueful
air, and the Baron was about to pour forth all his bottled-up
indignation, when at the sight of the driver’s face he
started back in blank astonishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is I indeed, my dear Baron,”</span> replied that gentleman,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg92" id="Pg92" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
politely. <span class="tei tei-q">“I must ask a thousand pardons for
causing you this trifling inconvenience. As to your
friend, I don’t know how I am to make my peace with
her.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot—bot vat means zis?”</span> gasped the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was merely endeavouring to provide the spice of
romance you required, besides giving you the opportunity
of making the lady’s better acquaintance. Can I do
anything more for you, Baron? And you, my dear
lady, can I assist you in any way?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both, speaking at once and with some heat, gave a
decidedly affirmative answer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where are we?”</span> asked the lady, who hovered between
fright and indignation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It would be rash to hazard an opinion,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well!”</span> cried the lady, her indignation quite overcoming
her fright. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mean to say you’ve brought
us here against our wills and probably got me
into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dreadful</span></span>
trouble, and you don’t even know where we are?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker looked up at the heavens with a studious
air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></span> to be
able to tell something of our whereabouts
from one of those stars,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“but, to tell
the truth, I don’t quite know which. In short, madame,
it is not from want of goodwill, but merely through
ignorance, that I cannot direct you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lady turned impatiently to the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">You’ve</span></span> helped
to get me into this mess,”</span> she said,
tartly. <span class="tei tei-q">“What do you propose to do?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg93" id="Pg93" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My fairest&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t!”</span> she interrupted, stamping her foot on the
frosty road, and then inconsequently burst into tears.
The Baron and Mr Bunker looked at one another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a fine night for a walk, and the cab, I’m afraid,
is smashed beyond hope of redemption. Give the lady
your arm, Baron; we must eventually arrive somewhere.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was really nothing else for it, so leaving the horse
and cab to be recovered by the first policeman who chanced
to pass, they set out on foot. At last, after half an hour’s
ramble through the solitudes of South London, a belated
cab was hailed and all three got inside. Once on her
way home, the lady’s indignation again gave way to
fright.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am</span></span> I to do?
What <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am</span></span> I to do?”</span> she wailed.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, whatever will my husband say?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his most confident and irresistible manner Mr
Bunker told her he would make matters all right for her
at whatever cost to himself; and so infectious was his
assurance, that, when at last they reached Eaton Square,
she allowed him to come up to the door of number 602.
The Baron prudently remained in the cab, for, as he explained,
<span class="tei tei-q">“My English, he is unsafe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a prolonged knocking and ringing the door at
length opened, and an irascible-looking, middle-aged
gentleman appeared, arrayed in a dressing-gown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Louisa!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“What the dev—where on earth
have you been? The police are looking for you all over
London. And may I venture to ask who this is with
you?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg94" id="Pg94" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker bowed slightly and raised his hat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear sir,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“we found this lady in a
lamentable state of intoxication in the Tottenham Court
Road, and as I understand you have a kind of reversionary
interest in her, we have brought her here. As for
you, sir, your appearance is so unprepossessing that I
am unable to remain any longer. Good night,”</span> and
raising his hat again he entered the cab and drove off,
assuring the Baron that matters were satisfactorily
arranged.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So you have had your adventure, Baron,”</span> he added,
with a smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a minute or two the Baron was silent. Then he
broke into a cheerful guffaw, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha! You are a
fonny devil, Bonker! Ach, bot it vas pleasant vile it
lasted!”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days passed in the most entertaining manner.
A menu of amusements was regularly prepared suitable
to a catholic taste, and at every turn the Baron was
struck by the enterprise and originality of his friend.
He had, however, a national bent for serious inquiry,
and now and then doubts crossed his mind whether,
with all his moral drawing, he was acquiring quite as
much solid information as he had set out to gain. This
idea grew upon him, till one morning, after gazing for
some time at the English newspaper he always made a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg95" id="Pg95" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
point of reading, he suddenly exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker, I haf
a doubt!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have many,”</span> replied Mr Bunker; <span class="tei tei-q">“in fact, I have
few positive ideas left.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot mine is a particulair doubt. Do I lairn enoff?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My own conception of enough learning, Baron, is a
thing like a threepenny-bit—the smallest coin one can do
one’s marketing with.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And yet,”</span> said the Baron, solemnly, <span class="tei tei-q">“for my own
share, I am not satisfied. I vould lairn more of ze British
institutions; so far I haf lairned of ze pleasures only.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, they are the British institutions.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron shook his head and fell to his paper again,
while Mr Bunker stretched himself on the sofa and
gazed through his cigar-smoke at the ceiling. Suddenly
the Baron gave an exclamation of horror.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, what is the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yet anozer outrage!”</span> cried the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Zese anarchists,
zey are too scandalous. At all ze stations zere
are detectives, and all ze ships are being vatched. Ach,
it is terrible!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker seemed struck with an idea, for he stared
at the ceiling without making any reply, and his eyes,
had the Baron seen them, twinkled curiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the Baron laid down his paper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vell, vat shall ve do?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let us come first to Liverpool Street Station, if you
don’t mind, Baron,”</span> his friend suggested. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have something
in the cloak-room there I want to pick up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Bonker, I shall go vere you vill; bot remember
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg96" id="Pg96" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I vant to-day more instrogtion and less entertainment.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You wish to see the practical side of English life?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yah—zat is, yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker smiled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I must entertain myself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they drove down he was in his wittiest humour,
and the Baron, in spite of his desire for instruction, was
more charmed with his friend than ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat fonny zing vill you do next, eh?”</span> he asked, as
they walked arm-in-arm into the station.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am no more the humourist, my dear Baron,—I
shall endeavour to edify you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had arrived at a busy hour, when the platforms
were crowded with passengers and luggage. A train
had just come in, and around it the bustle was at its
height, and the confusion most bewildering.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Wait for me here,”</span> said Mr Bunker; <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be
back in a minute.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He started in the direction of the cloak-room, and
then, doubling back through the crowd, walked down
the platform and stopped opposite a luggage-van. An
old gentleman, beside himself with irritation, was struggling
with the aid of a porter to collect his luggage, and
presently he left the pile he had got together and made
a rush in the direction of a large portmanteau that was
just being tumbled out. Instantly Mr Bunker picked
up a handbag from the heap and walked quickly off
with it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here you are, Baron,”</span> he said, as he came up to his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg97" id="Pg97" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
friend. <span class="tei tei-q">“I find there is something else I must do, so do
you mind holding this bag for a few minutes? If you
will walk up and down in front of the refreshment-rooms
here, I’ll find you more easily. Is it troubling you too
much?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not vun bit, Bonker. I am in your sairvice.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He put the bag into the Baron’s hand with his pleasantest
smile, and turned away. Rounding a corner, he
came cautiously back again through the crowd and
stepped up to a policeman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Keep your eye on that man, officer,”</span> he said, in a low
confidential voice, and an air of quiet authority, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
put your plain clothes’ men on his track. I know him
for one of the most dangerous anarchists.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man started and stared hard at the Baron, and
presently that unconscious nobleman, pacing the platform
in growing wonder at Mr Bunker’s lengthy absence,
and looking anxiously round him on all sides, noticed
with surprise that a number of quietly dressed men,
with no apparent business in the station, were eyeing
him with, it seemed to him, an interest that approached
suspicion. In time he grew annoyed, he returned their
glances with his haughtiest and most indignant look,
and finally, stepping up to one of them, asked in no friendly
voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Vat for do you vatch me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man returned an evasive answer, and passing one
of his fellow-officers, whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Foreign; I was sure
of it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the Baron could stand it no longer, and laying
the bag down by the door of the refreshment-room,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg98" id="Pg98" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
turned hastily away. On the instant Mr Bunker, who
had watched these proceedings from a safe distance,
cried in a loud and agonised voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Down with your
men, sergeant! Down, lie down! It will explode in
twenty seconds!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as he spoke he threw himself flat on his face.
So infectious were his commanding voice and his note
of alarm that one after another, detectives, passengers,
and porters, cast themselves at full length on the platform.
The Baron, filled with terror of anarchist plots,
was one of the first to prostrate himself, and at that there
could be no further doubt of the imminence of the peril.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cabs rattled and voices sounded from outside;
an engine whistled and shunted at a far platform, but
never before at that hour of the day had Liverpool Street
Station been so silent. All held their breath and heard
their hearts thump as they gazed in horrible fascination
at that fatal bag, or with closed eyes stumbled through
a hasty prayer. Fully a minute passed, and the suspense
was growing intolerable, when with a loud oath an old
gentleman rose to his feet and walked briskly up to the
bag.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have a care, sir! For Heaven’s sake have a care!”</span>
cried Mr Bunker; but the old gentleman merely bent
over the terrible object, and, picking it up, exclaimed
in bewildered wrath, <span class="tei tei-q">“It’s my bag! Who the devil
brought it here, and what’s the meaning of this d—d
nonsense?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!”</span> roared Mr Bunker; while like
sheepish mushrooms the people sprang up on all sides.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg99" id="Pg99" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear sir,”</span> said Mr Bunker, coming up to the old
gentleman, and raising his hat with his most affable air,
<span class="tei tei-q">“permit me to congratulate you on recovering your lost
property, and allow me further to introduce my friend
the Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Baron von damned-humbug!”</span> cried the old gentleman.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did you take my bag, sir? and if so, are you a
thief or a lunatic?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For an instant even Mr Bunker himself seemed a trifle
taken aback; then he replied politely, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not a thief,
sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">’ave</span></span> you
been doing?”</span> demanded the sergeant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Merely demonstrating to my friend the Baron the
extraordinary vigilance of the English police.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time neither the old gentleman nor the sergeant
seemed quite capable of taking the same view of the
episode as Mr Bunker, and, curiously enough, the Baron
seemed not disinclined to let his friend extricate himself
as best he could. No one, however, could resist Mr
Bunker, and before very long he and the Baron were
driving up Bishopsgate Street together, with the old
gentleman’s four-wheeler lumbering in front of them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Baron, are you satisfied with your morning’s
instruction?”</span> asked his friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A German nobleman is not used to be in soch a
position,”</span> replied the Baron, stiffly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must admit, however, that the object-lesson in
the detection of anarchy was neatly presented.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I admit nozing of ze kind,”</span> said the Baron, stolidly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the rest of the drive he sat obdurately silent. He
went to his room with the mien of an offended man.
During lunch he only opened his lips to eat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On his side Mr Bunker maintained a cheerful composure,
and seemed not a whit put about by his friend’s
lack of appreciation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Anozzer bottle of claret,”</span> said the Baron, gruffly, to
a waiter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker let him consume it entirely by himself,
awaiting the results with patience. Gradually his face
relaxed a little, until all at once, when the bump in the
bottom of the bottle was beginning to appear above the
wine, the whole room was startled by a stentorian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha,
ha, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Bonker!”</span> cried the Baron, when he had
finished laughing, <span class="tei tei-q">“forgif me! I begin for to see ze
moral, ha, ha, ha!”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron expressed no further wish for instruction,
but, instead, he began to show a desire for society.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Doesn’t one fool suffice?”</span> his friend asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, yes, my vise fool; ha, ha, ha! Bot sometimes
I haf ze craving for peoples, museec, dancing—in vun
vord, society, Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But this is not the season, Baron. You wouldn’t
mix with any but the best society, would you?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zere are some nobles in town. In my paper I see
Lord zis, Duke of zat, in London. Pairhaps my introdogtions
might be here now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This suggestion seemed to strike Mr Bunker unfavourably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My company is beginning to pall, is it, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, no, dear Bonker! I vould merely go out jost
vunce or tvice. Haf you no friends now in town?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An idea seemed to seize Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see the paper,”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After perusing it carefully for a little, he at last exclaimed
in a tone of pleased discovery, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hullo! I see
that Lady Tulliwuddle is giving a reception and dance
to-night. Most of the smart people in town just now
are sure to be there. Would you care to go, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, surely,”</span> said the Baron, eagerly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bot haf
you been invited, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I used to have a standing invitation to Lady
Tulliwuddle’s dances, and I’m certain she would be glad
to see me again.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can you take me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course, my dear Baron, she will be honoured.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot!”</span> cried the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ve shall go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker explained that it was the proper thing to
arrive very late, and so it was not until after twelve o’clock
that they left the Hôtel Mayonaise for the regions of
Belgravia. The Baron, primed with a bottle of champagne,
and arrayed in a costume which Mr Bunker had
assured him was the very latest extreme of fashion, and
which included a scarlet watered silk waistcoat, a pair
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of white silk socks, and a lavender tie, was in a condition
of cheerfulness verging closely on hilarity. Mr
Bunker, that, as he said, he might better serve as a
foil to his friend’s splendour, went more inconspicuously
dressed, but was likewise well charged with champagne.
He too was in his happiest vein, and the vision of the
Baron’s finery appeared to afford him peculiar gratification.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their hansom stopped in front of a large and gaily
lit-up mansion, with an awning leading to the door,
and a cluster of carriages and footmen by the kerbstone.
They entered, and having divested themselves of their
coats, Mr Bunker proposed that they should immediately
seek the supper-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot should I not be first introduced to mine hostess?”</span>
asked the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron! a formal reception of the guests is
entirely foreign to English etiquette.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zo? I did not know zat.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The supper-room was crowded, and having secured a
table with some difficulty, Mr Bunker entered immediately
into conversation with a solitary young gentleman
who was consuming a plate of oysters. Before they had
exchanged six sentences the young man had entirely
succumbed to Mr Bunker’s address, aided possibly by
the young man’s supper.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Permit me to introduce my friend the Baron Rudolph
von Blitzenberg, a nobleman strange as yet to England,
but renowned throughout his native land alike for his
talents and his lofty position,”</span> said Mr Bunker.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, my good friend,”</span> exclaimed the Baron, grasping
the young man’s hand, <span class="tei tei-q">“das ist Bonker’s vat you call
nonsense; bot I am delighted, zehr delighted, to meet
you, and if you gom to Bavaria you most shoot vid me!
Bravo! Ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From which it may be gathered that the Baron was in
a genial humour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is that girl?”</span> asked Mr Bunker, pointing to an
extremely pretty damsel just leaving the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, that’s my cousin, Lady Muriel Hilton. She’s
thought rather pretty, I believe,”</span> answered the young
man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you mind introducing me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly,”</span> said their new friend. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come along.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they were passing through the room a little incident
occurred that, if the Baron’s perceptions had been keener,
might have given him cause for some speculation. Two
men standing by the door looked hard at Mr Bunker,
and then at each other, and as the Baron passed them
he heard one say, <span class="tei tei-q">“It looks devilish like him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He has shaved, then,”</span> said the other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Evidently,”</span> replied the first speaker; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I thought
he was unlikely to appear in any society for some time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They both laughed, and the Baron heard no more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When they reached the ballroom the band was striking
up a polka, and presently Mr Bunker, with his accustomed
grace, was tearing round the room with Lady Muriel,
while the Baron—the delight of all eyes in his red
waistcoat—led out her sister. In a very short time the other
dancers found the Baron and his friend’s onslaught so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vigorous that prudence compelled them to take shelter
along the wall, and from a safe distance admire the
evolutions of these two mysterious guests.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker was enlivening the monotony of the polka
by the judicious introduction of hornpipe steps, while
the Baron, his coat-tails high above his head, shouted and
stamped in his wild career.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do stop for a minute, Baron,”</span> gasped his fair partner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Himmel, nein!”</span> roared the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“I haf gom here
for to dance! Ha, Bonker, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last Lady Muriel had to stop through sheer exhaustion,
but Mr Bunker, merely letting her go, pursued his
solitary way, double-shuffling and kicking unimpeded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron stopped, breathless, to admire him. Round
and round he went, the only figure in the middle of the
room, his arms akimbo, his feet rat-tatting and kicking
to the music, while high above the band resounded his
friend’s shouts of <span class="tei tei-q">“Bravo, Bonker! Wunderschön!
Gott in himmel, higher, higher!”</span> till at length, missing
the wall in an attempt to find support, the Baron dropped
with a thud into a sitting posture and continued his demonstrations
from the floor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile their alarmed hostess was holding a hasty
consultation with her husband, and when the music at
last stopped and Mr Bunker was advancing with his
most courteous air towards his late partner, Lord Tulliwuddle
stepped up to him and touched his arm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I speak to you, sir?”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly,”</span> replied Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be honoured.
Excuse me for one moment, Lady Muriel.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At whose invitation have you come here to-night?”</span>
demanded his host, sternly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have the pleasure of addressing Lord Tulliwuddle,
have I not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker bent towards him and whispered something
in his ear.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“From Scotland Yard?”</span> exclaimed his lordship.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> said Mr Bunker, glancing cautiously round
the room, and then he added, with an air of impressive
gravity, <span class="tei tei-q">“You have a bathroom on the third floor, I
believe?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have,”</span> replied his host in great surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Has it a bell?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, I believe not.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, I thought so. If you will favour me by coming
up-stairs for a minute, my Lord, you will avoid a serious
private scandal. Say nothing about it at present to any
one.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In blank astonishment and some alarm Lord Tulliwuddle
went up with him to the third floor, where the
house was still and the sounds of revelry reached faintly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What does this mean, sir?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If I am right in my conjectures you will need no
explanation from me, my Lord.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His lordship opened a door, and turning on an electric
light, revealed a small and ordinary-looking bathroom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, no bell—excellent!”</span> said Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What are you doing with the key?”</span> exclaimed his
host.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good night, my Lord. I shall tell them to send up
breakfast at nine,”</span> said Mr Bunker, and stepping quickly
out, he shut and locked the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A minute later he was back in the ballroom looking
anxiously for the Baron, but that nobleman was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The devil!”</span> he said to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can they have
tackled him too?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as he ran downstairs a gust of cheerful laughter
set his mind at ease.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha! Vere is old Bonker? He also vill shoot
vid me!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Here I am, my dear Baron,”</span> he exclaimed gaily,
as he tracked the voice into the supper-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, mine dear Bonker!”</span> cried the Baron, folding
him in his muscular embrace, <span class="tei tei-q">“I haf here met friends,
ve are merry! Ve drink to Bavaria, to England, to
everyzing!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“friends”</span> consisted of two highly amused young
men and two half-scandalised, half-hysterical ladies,
into the midst of whose supper-table the Baron had projected
himself with infectious hilarity. They all looked
up with great curiosity at Mr Bunker, but that gentleman
was not in the least put about. He bowed politely to
the table generally, and took his friend by the arm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is time we were going, Baron,
I’m afraid,”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat for? Ah, not yet, Bonker, not yet. I am enjoying
myself down to ze floor. I most dance again, Bonker,
jost vunce more,”</span> pleaded the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, the noblemen of highest rank must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
always leave first, and people are talking of going now.
Come along, old man.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, is zat so?”</span> said the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Zen vill I go.
Good night!”</span> he cried, waving his hand to the room
generally. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ven you gom to Bavaria you most all
shoot vid me. Bravo, my goot Bonker! Ha! ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they turned away from the table, one of the young
men, who had been looking very hard at Mr Bunker,
rose and touched his sleeve.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I say, aren’t you&mdash;&mdash;?”</span> he began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Possibly I am,”</span> interrupted Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“only I
haven’t the slightest recollection of the fact.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An astonished lady was indicated by Mr Bunker as
the hostess, and to her the Baron bade an affectionate
adieu. He handed a sovereign to the footman, embraced
the butler, and as they sped eastwards in their hansom,
a rousing chorus from the two friends awoke the echoes
of Piccadilly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bravo, Bonker! Himmel, I haf enjoyed myself!”</span>
sighed the exhausted Baron.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron and Mr Bunker discussed a twelve o’clock
breakfast with the relish of men who had done a good
night’s work. The Baron was full of his exploits. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ze
lofly Lady Hilton”</span> and his new <span class="tei tei-q">“friends”</span> seemed to
have made a vivid impression.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zey vill be in ze Park to-day, of course?”</span> he suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Possibly,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, without any great
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But surely.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“After a dance it is rather unlikely.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze Lady Hilton did say she vent to ze Park.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To-day, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not remember to-day. I did dance so hard I
was not perhaps distinct. But I shall go and see.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Mr Bunker’s attempts to throw cold water on this
scheme proved quite futile, he made a graceful virtue of
necessity, dressed himself with care, and set out in the
afternoon for the Park. They had only walked as far
as Piccadilly Circus when in the crowd at the corner his
eye fell upon a familiar figure. It was the burly, red-faced
man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The devil! Moggridge again!”</span> he muttered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment he thought they were going to pass
unobserved: then the man turned his head their way,
and Mr Bunker saw him start. He never looked over
his shoulder, but after walking a little farther he called
the Baron’s attention to a shop window, and they stopped
to look at it. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Moggridge
about twenty yards behind them stopping too.
He was glancing towards them very doubtfully. Evidently
his mind was not yet made up, and at once Mr
Bunker’s fertile brain began to revolve plans.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little farther on they paused before another window,
and exactly the same thing happened. Then Mr Bunker
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
made up his mind. He looked carefully at the cabs,
and at last observed a smart-looking young man driving
a fresh likely horse at a walking pace beside the pavement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He caught the driver’s eye and raised his stick, and
turning suddenly to the Baron with a gesture of annoyance,
exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Forgive my rudeness, Baron, I’m
afraid I must leave you. I had clean forgotten an important
engagement in the city for this afternoon.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Appointment in ze city?”</span> said the Baron in considerable
surprise. <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not know you had friends
in ze city.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have just heard from my father’s man of business,
and I’m afraid it would be impolitic not to see him. Do
you mind if I leave you here?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Surely, my dear fellow, I vould not stop you. Already
I feel at home by myself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then we shall meet at the hotel before dinner. Good
luck with the ladies, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker jumped into the cab, saying only to the
driver, <span class="tei tei-q">“To the city, as quick as you can.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What part, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, say the Bank. Hurry up!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then as the man whipped up, Mr Bunker had a glimpse
of Moggridge hailing another cab, and peeping cautiously
through the little window at the back he saw him starting
in hot pursuit. He took five shillings out of his pocket
and opened the trap-door in the roof.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you see that other cab chasing us, with a red-faced
man inside?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker handed his driver the money.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Get rid of him, then. Take me anywhere through
the city you like, and when he’s off the scent let me
know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Very good, sir,”</span> replied the driver, cracking his whip
till his steed began to move past the buses and the other
cabs like a train.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On they flew, clatter and jingle, twisting like a snipe
through the traffic. Mr Bunker perceived that he had a
good horse and a good driver, and he smiled in pleasant
excitement. He lit a cigar, leaned his arms on the doors,
and settled himself to enjoy the race.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The black lions of Trafalgar Square flew by, then
the colossal hotels of Northumberland Avenue and the
railway bridge at Charing Cross, and they were going
at a gallop along the Embankment. He got swift glimpses
of other cabs and foot-passengers, the trees seemed to
flit past like telegraph-posts on a railway, the barges and
lighters on the river dropped one by one behind them:
it was a fair course for a race, with never a check before
Blackfriar’s Bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they turned into Queen Victoria Street he opened
the lid and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are they still in sight?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir; I’m afraid we ain’t gaining much yet. But
I’ll do it, sir, no fears.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker lay back and laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This is better than the Park,”</span> he said to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had a fine drive up Queen Victoria Street before
they plunged into the whirlpool of traffic at the Bank.
They were slowly making their way across when the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
driver, spying an opening in another stream, abruptly
wheeled round for Cornhill, and presently they were off
again at top speed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thrown them off?”</span> asked Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tried to, sir, but they were too sharp and got clear
away too.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker saw that it was going to be a stern chase,
and laughed again. In order that he might not show
ostensibly that he was running away, he resisted the
temptation of having another peep through the back,
and resigned himself to the chances of the chase.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through and through the lanes and byways of the city
they drove, and after each double the answer from the
box was always the same. The cab behind could not be
shaken off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Work your way round to Holborn and try a run west,”</span>
Mr Bunker suggested.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So after a little they struck Newgate Street, and presently
their steed stretched himself again in Holborn Viaduct.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gaining now, cabby?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A little, sir, I think.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker sat placidly till they were well along Holborn
before he inquired again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can’t get rid of ’im no ’ow.
Afride it ain’t much good, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker passed up five shillings more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Keep your tail up. You’ll do it yet,”</span> he exhorted.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Try a turn north; you may bother him among the
squares.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So they doubled north, and as the evening closed in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their wearied horse was lashed through a maze of monotonous
streets and tarnished Bloomsbury Squares.
And still the other cab stuck to their trail. But when
they emerged on the Euston Road, Mr Bunker was as
cheerful as ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They can’t last much longer,”</span> he said to his driver.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Turn up Regent’s Park way.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little later he put the usual question and got the
same unvarying answer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horse was evidently beginning to fail, and he saw
that this chariot-race must soon come to an end. The
street-lamps and the shop windows were all lit up by this
time, and the dusk was pretty thick. It seemed to him
that he might venture to try his luck on foot, and he
began to look out for an opening where a cab could not
follow.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were flogging along a noisy stone-paved road
where there was little other traffic; on one side stood an
unbroken row of houses, and on the other were small
semi-detached villas with little strips of garden about
them. All at once he saw a doctor’s red lamp over the
door of one of these half villas, and an inspiration came
upon him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One can always visit a doctor,”</span> he said to himself, and
smiled in great amusement at something in the reflection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped the cab, handed the man half a sovereign,
and saying only, <span class="tei tei-q">“Drive away again, quickly,”</span> jumped
out, glanced at the name on the plate, and pulled the bell.
As he waited on the step he saw the other cab stop a little
way back, and his pursuer emerge.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A frowsy little servant opened the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is Dr Twiddel at home?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dr Twiddel’s abroad, sir,”</span> said the maid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No one in at all, then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dr Billson sees ’is patients, sir—w’en
there <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span> any.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“When do you expect Dr Billson?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In about an hour, sir, ’e usually comes hin.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Excellent!”</span> thought Mr Bunker. Aloud he said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I’m a patient. I’ll come in and wait.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stepped in, and the door banged behind him.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This w’y, sir,”</span> said the maid, and Mr Bunker found
himself in the little room where this story opened.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment he was alone he went to the window and
peeped cautiously between the slats of the venetian blind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The street was quiet, both cabs had disappeared, and
for a minute or two he could see nothing even of Moggridge.
Then a figure moved carefully from the shelter
of a bush a little way down the railings, and, after a quick
look at the house, stepped back again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He means to play the waiting game,”</span> said Mr Bunker
to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Long may you wait, my wary Moggridge!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took a rapid survey of the room. He saw the
medical library, the rented furniture, and the unlit gas-stove;
and at last his eye fell upon a box of cigarettes.
To one of these he helped himself and leaned his back
against the mantelpiece.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There must be at least one room at the back,”</span> he
reflected; <span class="tei tei-q">“that room must have a window, and beyond
that window there is all London to turn to. Friend
Moggridge, I trust you are prepared to spend the evening
behind your bush.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had another look through the blind and shook his
head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A little too light yet,—I’d better wait for a quarter
of an hour or so.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To while away the time he proceeded to make a tour of
the room, for, as he said to himself, when in an unknown
country any information may possibly come in useful.
There was nothing whatever from which he could draw
even the most superficial deduction till he came to the
writing-desk. Here a heap of bills were transfixed by a
long skewer, and at his first glance at the uppermost his
face assumed an expression of almost ludicrous bewilderment.
He actually rubbed his eyes before he looked a second time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One dozen shirts,”</span> he read, <span class="tei tei-q">“four under-flannels,
four pair socks, one dozen handkerchiefs, two sleeping-suits—marked
Francis Beveridge! the account rendered
to Dr G. Twiddel! What in the name of wonderment
is the meaning of this?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sat down with the bill in his hand and gazed hard
at it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Precisely my outfit,”</span> he said to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Am I—Does it&mdash;&mdash;? What a rum thing!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sat for about ten minutes looking hard at the floor.
Then he burst out laughing, resumed in a moment his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
air of philosophical opportunism, and set about a further
search of the desk. He looked at the bills and seemed to
find nothing more to interest him. Then he glanced at
one or two letters in the drawers, threw the first few back
again, and at last paused over one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Twiddel to Billson,”</span> he said to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“This
may possibly be worth looking at.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was dated more than a month back from the town
of Fogelschloss.</p>

<div class="block tei tei-q">
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dear Tom,”</span> it ran, <span class="tei tei-q">“we are having
  an A 1 time. Old Welsh is in splendid form, doing the part
  to perfection. He has never given himself away yet, not even
  when drunk, which, I am sorry to say, he has been too
  often. But then old Welsh is so funny when he is drunk
  that it makes him all the more like the original, or at
  least what the original is supposed to be.</span></p>
  
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course we don’t dare to
  venture into places where
  we would see too many English. This is quite an amusing
  place for a German town, some baths and a kind of
  a gambling-table, and some pretty girls—for Germans.
  There is a sporting aristocrat here, in an old castle, who
  is very friendly, and is much impressed with Welsh’s
  account of his family plate and deer-forest, and has asked
  us once or twice to come out and see him. We are no
  end of swells, I assure you.</span></p>
  
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ta, ta, old chap. Hope the practice
  prospers in your hands. Don’t kill
  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> the
  patients before I come back.—Ever thine,</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: right">
  <span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: right"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">GEORGE TWIDDEL</span></span>.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“From this I conclude that Dr Twiddel is on the
festive side of forty,”</span> he reflected; <span class="tei tei-q">“there are elements
of mystery and a general atmosphere of alcohol about
it, but that’s all, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He put it back in the drawer, but the bill he slipped
into his pocket.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> thought he, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is time I made the first
move.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After waiting for a minute or two to make sure that
everything was quiet, he gently stepped out into a little
linoleum-carpeted hall. On the right hand was the
front door, on the left two others that must, he thought,
open into rooms on the back. He chose the nearer at a
venture, and entered boldly. It was quite dark. He
closed the door again softly, struck a match, and looked
round the room. It seemed to be Dr Twiddel’s dining-
and sitting-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pipes, photographs, well-sat-in chairs,”</span> he observed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> a window.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pulled aside the blind and looked out into the darkness
of a strip of back-garden. For a minute he listened
intently, but no sound came from the house. Then he
threw up the sash and scrambled out. It was quite dark
by this time: he was enclosed between two rows of vague,
black houses, with bright windows here and there, and
chimney-cans faintly cutting their uncouth designs among
a few pale London stars. The space between was filled
with the two lines of little gardens and the ranks of walls,
and in the middle the black chasm of a railway cutting.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A frightened cat bolted before him as he hurried down
to the foot of the strip, but that was all the life he saw.
He looked over the wall right into the deep crevasse.
A little way off, on the one hand, hung a cluster of
signal-lights, and the shining rails reflected them all along to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the mouth of a tunnel on the other. Turning his head
this way and that, there was nothing to be seen anywhere
else but garden wall after garden wall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s a choice between a hurdle-race through these
gardens, a cat-walk along this wall, and a descent into
the cutting,”</span> he reflected. <span class="tei tei-q">“The walls look devilish high
and the cutting devilish deep. Hang me if I know
which road to take.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While he was still debating this somewhat perplexing
question, he felt the ground begin to quiver under him.
Through the hum of London there gradually arose a
louder roar, and in a minute the head-lights of an engine
flashed out of the tunnel. One after another a string of
bright carriages followed it, each more slowly than the
carriage in front, till the whole train was at a standstill
below him with the red signal-lamp against it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an instant his decision was taken. At the peril of
life and garments he scrambled down the rocky bank,
picking as he went an empty first-class compartment,
and just as the train began to move again he swung himself
up and sprang into a carriage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately he had chosen the wrong one in his
haste, and as he opened the door he saw a comical vision
of a stout little old gentleman huddling into the farther
corner in the most dire consternation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you, sir? What do you want, sir?”</span> spluttered
the old gentleman. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you come any nearer me,
sir—one step, sir!—I shall instantly communicate with
the guard! I have no money about me. Go away,
sir!”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I regret to learn that you have no money,”</span> replied
Mr Bunker, imperturbably; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I am sorry that I am
not at present in a condition to offer a loan.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sat down and smiled amicably, but the little gentleman
was not to be quieted so easily. Seeing that no
violence was apparently intended, his fright changed into
respectable indignation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You needn’t try to be funny with me, sir. You are
committing an illegal act. You have placed yourself in
an uncommonly serious position, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed, sir?”</span> replied Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“I myself should
have imagined that by remaining on the rails I should
have been much more seriously situated.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old gentleman looked at him like an angry small
dog that longs to bite if it only dared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is the meaning of this illegal intrusion?”</span> he
demanded. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you? Where did you come
from?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I had the misfortune, sir,”</span> explained Mr Bunker,
politely, <span class="tei tei-q">“to drop my hat out of the window of a neighbouring
carriage. While I was picking it up the train started,
and I had to enter the first compartment I could find. I
am sorry that my entry frightened you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Frightened me!”</span> spluttered the old gentleman. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
am not afraid, sir. I am an honest man who need fear
no one, sir. I do not believe you dropped your hat. It
is perfectly uninjured.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It may be news to you, sir,”</span> replied Mr Bunker,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that by gently yet firmly passing the sleeve of your coat
round your hat in the direction of the nap, it is possible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to restore the gloss. Thus,”</span> and suiting the action to
the word he took off his hat, drew his coat-sleeve across
it, and with a genial smile at the old gentleman, replaced
it on his head.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But his neighbour was evidently of that truculent disposition
which merely growls at blandishments. He
snorted and replied testily, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is all very well, sir, but
I don’t believe a word of it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you prefer it, then, I fell off the telegraph wires in
an attempt to recover my boots.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old gentleman became purple in the face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have a care, sir! I am a director of this company,
and at the next station I shall see that you give a proper
account of yourself. And here we are, sir. I trust you
have a more credible story in readiness.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke they drew up beside an underground
platform, and the irascible old gentleman, with a very
threatening face that was not yet quite cleared of alarm,
bustled out in a prodigious hurry. Mr Bunker lay back
in his seat and replied with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be delighted
to tell any story within the bounds of strict propriety.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the moment he saw the irate director disappear
in the crowd he whipped out too, and with the least
possible delay transferred himself into a third-class
carriage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From his seat near the window he watched the old
gentleman hurry back with three officials at his heels,
and hastily search each first-class compartment in turn.
The last one was so near him that he could hear his friend
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Damn it, the rascal has bolted in the crowd!”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And with that the four of them rushed off to the barrier
to intercept or pursue this suspicious character. Then
the whistle blew, and as the train moved off Mr Bunker
remarked complacently, if a little mysteriously, to himself,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, whoever I am, it would seem I’m rather
difficult to catch.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker arrived at the Hôtel Mayonaise in what,
from his appearance, was an unusually reflective state of
mind for him. The other visitors, many of whom had
begun to regard him and his noble friend with great
interest, saw him pass through the crowd in the hall
and about the lifts with a thoughtful air. He went
straight to the Baron’s room. Outside the door he
paused for an instant to set his face in a cheerful smile,
and then burst gaily in upon his friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, my dear Baron!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“what luck in the
Park?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron was pulling his moustache over an English
novel. He laid down his book and frowned at Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not onderstand your English vays,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker perceived that something was very much
amiss, nor was he without a suspicion of the cause. He
laughed, however, and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“What’s the matter, old
man?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I vent to ze Park,”</span> said the Baron, with a solemn
deliberation that evidently came hardly to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entered ze Park. I vas dressed, as you know, viz taste
and appropriety. I vas sober, as you know. I valked
under ze trees, and I looked agreeably at ze people.
Goddam!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron!”</span> expostulated Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron resumed his intense composure with a
great effort.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not long vas ven I see ze Lady Hilton drive past mit
ze ozzer Lady Hilton and vun old lady. I raise my
hat—no bow from zem. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pairhaps,’</span> I zink, <span class="tei tei-q">‘zey see me
not.’</span> Zey stop by ze side to speak viz a gentleman. I
gomed up and again I raise my hat and I say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘How do
you do, Lady Hilton? I hope you are regovered from
ze dance.’</span> Zat was gorrect, vas it not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perfectly,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, with great gravity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zen vy did ze Lady Hilton schream and ze ozzer
Lady Hilton cry, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ach, zat German man!’</span> And vy did
ze old lady schream to ze gentleman, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Send him avay!
How dare you? Insolence!’</span> and suchlike vords?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What remarkable conduct, my dear Baron!”</span> said
Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Remargable!”</span> roared the justly incensed Baron.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is it not more zan <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">remargable?</span></span> Donner und blitzen!
Mon Dieu! Blood! I know not ze English vord so bad
enoff for soch conduct.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It must have been a joke,”</span> his friend suggested,
soothingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vun dashed bad joke, zen! Ze gentleman said to
me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Get out of zis, you rasgal!’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Vat mean you, sare?’</span>
say I. <span class="tei tei-q">‘You know quite vell,’</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Glear out!’</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
So I gave him my card and tell him I would be glad to
see his frient zat he should send, for zat I vas not used
to be called zo. Zen I raise my hat to ze Lady Hilton
and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Adieu, madame, I know now ze English lady,’</span>
and I valk on. Himmel!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What a very extraordinary affair, Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron grunted with inarticulate indignation and
nearly pulled his moustache out by the roots. Abruptly
he broke out again, <span class="tei tei-q">“English ladies? I do not believe
zey are ladies! Never haf I been treated zo! Vat do
you mean, Bonker, by taking me among soch peoples?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>, my dear Baron?
It was not I who introduced
you to the Hiltons. I never saw them before.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difficulty of attaching any blame to his friend
seemed to have anything but a soothing effect on the
Baron. You could almost fancy that you heard his tail
lash the floor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zat vas not all,”</span> he continued, after a short struggle
with his wrath. <span class="tei tei-q">“I valked on, and soon I see two of ze
frients I made last night at supper.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Which two?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze yong man zat spoke to you ven you rise from ze
table, and vun of ze ladies. Again I raise my hat and
say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘How do you do? I hope zat you are regovered
from ze dance.’</span> Zat is gorrect, you say?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Under most circumstances.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze man stared at me, and ze voman—I vill not say
lady—says to him zo zat I can hear, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Zat awful German!’</span>
Ze man says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Zo it is,’</span> and laughed. <span class="tei tei-q">‘I haf ze pleasure
of meeting you last night at ze Lady Tollyvoddle,’</span> I said.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">‘I remember,’</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">‘but I haf no vish to meet you
again.’</span> I take out my card to gif him, but he only said,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Go avay, or I vill call ze police!’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ze police! To me,
Baron von Blitzenberg! Teufel!’</span> I replied.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And that was all, Baron?”</span> asked Mr Bunker, in
what seemed rather like a tone of relief.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No; suddenly he did turn back and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘By ze vay,
who vas zat viz you last night?’</span> To vich I replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘If you address me again, my man, I vill call ze police.
Go avay!’</span> ”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bravo, Baron! Ha, ha, ha! Excellent!”</span> laughed
Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This applause served to reinstate the Baron a little in
his own good opinion. He laughed too, though rather
noisily than heartily, and suddenly became grave again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat means zis, Bonker? Vat haf I done? Vy
should zey treat me zo?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you see, my dear Baron,”</span> his friend explained,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I ought to have warned you that it is not usual in England
to address ladies you have met at a dance without
some direct invitation on their part. At the same time,
it is evident that the Hiltons and the other man, who of
course must be connected with the Foreign Office, are
aware of some sudden strain in the diplomatic relations
between England and Germany, which as yet is unknown
to the public. Your ancient name and your high rank
have naturally led them to conclude that you are an agent
of the German Government, and an international significance
was of course attached to your presence in the
Park. I certainly think they took a most outrageous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
advantage of a trifling detail of etiquette to repulse you;
but then you must remember, Baron, that their families
might have been seriously compromised with the Government
if they had been seen with so prominent a member
of the German aristocracy in the middle of Hyde Park.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zo?”</span> said the Baron, thoughtfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“I begin to
onderstand. My name, as you say, is cairtainly distinguished.
Bot zen should I remain in London?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just what I was wondering, Baron. What do you
say to a trip down to St Egbert’s-on-Sea? It’s a very
select watering-place, and we might spend a week or two
there very pleasantly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Egxellent!”</span> said the Baron; <span class="tei tei-q">“ven shall we start?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow morning.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Goot! zo let it be. I am tired of London and of ze
English ladies’ manners. Police to ze Baron von Blitzenberg!
Ve shall go to St Egbert’s, Bonker!”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron and Mr Bunker walked arm-in-arm
along the esplanade at St Egbert’s-on-Sea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aha!”</span> said the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“zis is more fresh zan
London!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> replied his friend; <span class="tei tei-q">“we are now in the presence
of that stimulating element which provides patriotic Britons
with music-hall songs, and dyspeptic Britons with an
appetite.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A stirring breeze swept down the long white esplanade,
threatening hats and troubling skirts; the pale-green
south-coast sea rumbled up the shingle; the day was
bright and pleasant for the time of year, and drove the
Baron’s mischances from his head; altogether it seemed
to Mr Bunker that the omens were good. They were
both dressed in the smartest of tweed suits, and walked
jauntily, like men who knew their own value. Every
now and then, as they passed a pretty face, the Baron
would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Aha, Bonker! zat is not so bad, eh?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Mr Bunker, who seemed not unwilling that his
friend should find some entertaining distraction in St
Egbert’s, would look at the owners of these faces with a
prospector’s eye and his own unrivalled assurance.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had walked up and down three or four times,
when a desire for a different species of diversion began
to overtake the Baron. It was the one kind of desire
that the Baron never even tried to wrestle with.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My vriend Bonker,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it not somevere
about time for loncheon, eh?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should say it was precisely the hour.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha! zen, let us gom and eat. Himmel, zis sea
is ze fellow to make von hungry!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron had taken a private suite of rooms on the
first floor of the best hotel in St Egbert’s, and after a
very substantial lunch Mr Bunker stretched himself on
the luxurious sitting-room sofa and announced his intention
of having a nap.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall go out,”</span> said the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“You vill not gom?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall leave you to make a single-handed conquest,”</span>
replied Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“Besides, I have a little matter I
want to look into.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the Baron arranged his hat airily, at what he had
perceived to be the most fashionable and effective English
angle, and strutted off to the esplanade.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was about two hours later that he burst excitedly
into the room, crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Aha, mine Bonker! I haf disgovered
zomzing!”</span> and then he stopped in some surprise.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ello, vat make you, my vriend?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His friend, in fact, seemed to be somewhat singularly
employed. Through a dense cloud of tobacco-smoke you
could just pick him out of the depths of an armchair,
his feet resting on the mantelpiece, while his lap and all
the floor round about were covered with immense books.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Baron’s curiosity was still further excited by observing
that they consisted principally of a London and a
St Egbert’s directory, several volumes of a Dictionary
of National Biography, and one or two peerages and
county family compilations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked up with a smile. <span class="tei tei-q">“You may well wonder,
my dear Baron. The fact is, I am looking for a name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A name! vat name?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! if I knew what it was I should stop looking,
and I confess I’m rather sick of the job.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vich vay do you look, zen?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Simply by wading my way through all the lists of
names I could steal or borrow. It’s devilish dry work.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze name of a vriend, is it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes; but I’m afraid I must wait till it comes. And
what is this discovery, Baron? A petticoat, I presume.
After all, they are the only things worth finding,”</span> and he
shut the books one after another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A petticoat with ze fairest girl inside it!”</span> exclaimed
the Baron, rapturously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your eyes seem to have been singularly penetrating,
Baron. Was she dark or fair, tall or short, fat or slender,
widow, wife, or maid?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Fair, viz blue eyes, short pairhaps but not too short,
slender as a—a—drom-stick, and I vould say a maid; at
least I see vun stout old lady mit her, mozzer and daughter
I soppose.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And did this piece of perfection seem to appreciate
you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vy should I know? Zey are ze real ladies and pairtend
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not to see me, bot I zink zey notice me all ze same.
Not <span class="tei tei-q">‘lady vriends,’</span> Bonker, ha, ha, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker laughed with reminiscent amusement,
and inquired, <span class="tei tei-q">“And how did the romance end—in a cab,
Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> laughed the Baron; <span class="tei tei-q">“better zan zat,
Bonker—moch better!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s hardly the time of year for a romance to end in
a bathing-machine. You followed the divinity to her
rented heaven, perhaps?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron bent forward and answered in a stage
whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“Zey live in zis hotel, Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then I can only wish you joy, Baron, and if my
funds allow me, send her a wedding present.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, not quite so fast, my vriend! I am not caught
so easy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow, a week at close quarters is sufficient
to net any man.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ven I marry,”</span> replied the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“moch most be considered.
A von Blitzenberg does not mate viz every vun.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A good many families have made the same remark,
but one does not always meet the fathers-in-law.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha! ve shall see. Bot, Bonker, she is lofly!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron awaited dinner with even more than his
usual ardour. He dressed with the greatest care, and
at an absurdly early hour was already urging his friend
to come down and take their places. Indeed after a time
there was no withholding him, and they finally took their
seats in the dining-room before anybody else.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At what seemed to the impatient Baron unconscionably
long intervals a few people dropped in and began to
study their menus and glance with an air of uncomfortable
suspicion at their neighbours.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I vonder vill she gom,”</span> he said three or four times at
least.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Console yourself, my dear Baron,”</span> his friend would
reply; <span class="tei tei-q">“they always come. That’s seldom the difficulty.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the Baron would dally with his victuals in the
most unwonted fashion, and growl at the rapidity with
which the courses followed one another.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do zey suppose ve vish to eat like&mdash;&mdash;?”</span> he began,
and then laying his hand on his friend’s sleeve, he whispered,
<span class="tei tei-q">“She goms!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker turned his head just in time to see in the
doorway the Countess of Grillyer and the Lady Alicia à
Fyre.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is she not fair?”</span> asked the Baron, excitedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I entirely approve of your taste, Baron. I have only
once seen any one quite like her before.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a gratified smile the Baron filled his glass, while
his friend seemed amused by some humorous reflection
of his own.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lady Alicia and her mother had taken their seats
at a table a little way off, and at first their eyes never
happened to turn in the direction of the two friends.
But at last, after looking at the ceiling, the carpet, the
walls, the other people, everything else in the room it
seemed, Lady Alicia’s glance fell for an instant on the
Baron. That nobleman looked as interesting as a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mouthful of roast duck would permit him, but the glance
passed serenely on to Mr Bunker. For a moment it
remained serene; suddenly it became startled and puzzled,
and at that instant Mr Bunker turned his own eyes full
upon her, smiled slightly, and raised his glass to his
lips.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glance fell, and the Lady Alicia blushed down to
the diamonds in her necklace.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron insisted on lingering over his dinner till
the charmer was finished, and so by a fortuitous coincidence
they left the room immediately behind the Countess.
The Baron passed them in the passage, and a few
yards farther he looked round for his friend, and the
Countess turned to look for her daughter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They saw Lady Alicia following with an intensely
unconscious expression, while Mr Bunker was in the act
of returning to the dining-room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wanted to secure a table for breakfast,”</span> he explained.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron was in high hopes of seeing the fair unknown
at breakfast, but it seemed she must be either
breakfasting in her own room or lying long abed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think I shall go out for a little constitutional,”</span> said
Mr Bunker, when he had finished. <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose the hotel
has a stronger attraction for you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, yes, I shall remain,”</span> his friend replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pairhaps
I may see zem.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take care then, Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall not propose till you return, Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Mr Bunker to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t think
you will.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just outside St Egbert’s there is a high breezy sweep
of downs, falling suddenly to a chalky seaward cliff. It
overlooks the town and the undulating inland country
and a great spread of shining sea; and even without a
spy-glass you can see sail after sail and smoke-wreath
after smoke-wreath go by all day long.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Mr Bunker had apparently walked there for other
reasons than to see the view. He did stop once or twice,
but it was only to scan the downs ahead, and at the sight
of a fluttering skirt he showed no interest in anything
else, but made a straight line for its owner. For her part,
the lady seemed to await his coming. She gathered her
countenance into an expression of as perfect unconcern
as a little heightening of her colour would allow her, and
returned his salute with rather a distant bow. But Mr
Bunker was not to be damped by this hint of barbed wire.
He held out his hand and exclaimed cordially, <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear
Lady Alicia! this is charming of you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course you understand, Mr Beveridge, it’s only&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perfectly,”</span> he interrupted, gaily; <span class="tei tei-q">“I understand
everything I should and nothing I shouldn’t. In fact, I
have altered little, except in the trifling matter of a beard,
a moustache or two, and, by the way, a name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A name?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am now Francis Bunker, but as much at your
service as ever.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But why—I mean, have you really changed your
name?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Circumstances have changed it, just as circumstances
shaved me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia made a great endeavour to look haughty.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I do not quite understand, Mr&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bunker—a temporary title, but suggestive, and simple
for the tradesmen.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not understand your conduct. Why have you
changed your name?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This retort was so evidently unanswerable that Lady
Alicia changed her inquiry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where have you been?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Till yesterday, in London.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then you didn’t go to your own parish?”</span> she demanded,
reproachfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There were difficulties,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“in fact, a certified
lunatic is not in great demand as a parish priest. They
seem to prefer them uncertified.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But didn’t you try?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hard, but it was no use. The bishop was out of
town, and I had to wait till his return; besides, my position
was somewhat insecure. I have had at least two
remarkable escapes since I saw you last.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Are you safe here?”</span> she asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With your consent, yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked a little troubled. <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t know that I am
doing right, Mr Bev—Bunker, but&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank you, my friend,”</span> he interrupted, tenderly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t,”</span> she began, hastily. <span class="tei tei-q">“You mustn’t talk
like&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Francis Beveridge?”</span> he interrupted. <span class="tei tei-q">“The trouble
is, this rascal Bunker bears an unconscionably awkward
resemblance to our old friend.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must see that it is quite—ridiculous.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Absurd,”</span> he agreed,—<span class="tei tei-q">“perfectly preposterous. I
laugh whenever I think of it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Lady Alicia felt like a man at a telephone who
has been connected with the wrong person. Again she
made a desperate shift to fall back on a becoming pride.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span> she demanded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If I mean anything at all, which is always rather
doubtful,”</span> he replied, candidly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I mean that Beveridge
and his humbug were creatures of an occasion, just as
Bunker and his are of another. The one occasion is
passed, and with it the first entertaining gentleman has
vanished into space. The second gentleman will doubtless
follow when his time is up. In fact, I may be said
to be a series of dissolving views.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then isn’t what you said true?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m afraid you must be more specific; you see I’ve
talked so much.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What you said about yourself—and your work.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He shook his head humorously. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no means of
checking my statements.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked at him in a troubled way, and then her
eyes fell.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“At least,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you won’t—you
mustn’t treat me as—as you did.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As Beveridge did? Certainly not; Bunker is the
soul of circumspection. Besides, he doesn’t require to
get out of an asylum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then it was only to get away?”</span> she cried, turning
scarlet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let us call it so,”</span> he replied, looking pensively out to
sea.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed wiser to Lady Alicia to change the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is the friend you are staying with?”</span> she asked,
suddenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My old friend the Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg,
and your own most recent admirer,”</span> he replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
at present living with, in fact I may say upon, him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does he know?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you meet him, you had perhaps better not inquire
into my past history.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I meant, does he know about—about your knowing
me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bless them!”</span> thought Mr Bunker; <span class="tei tei-q">“one forgets they’re
not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">always</span></span> thinking about us!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My noble friend has no idea that I have been so
fortunate,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia looked relieved. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is he?”</span> she
asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A German nobleman of great wealth, long descent,
and the most accommodating disposition. He is at
present exploring England under my guidance, and I
flatter myself that he has already seen and done a number
of things that are not on most programmes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia was silent for a minute. Then she said
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with a little hesitation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Didn’t you get a letter from
me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A letter? No,”</span> he replied, in some surprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wrote twice—because you asked me to, and I
thought—I wondered if you were safe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To what address did you write?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The address you gave me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And what was that?”</span> he asked, still evidently puzzled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You said care of the Archbishop of York would find
you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker abruptly looked the other way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By Jove!”</span> he said, as if lost in speculation, <span class="tei tei-q">“I must
find out what the matter was. I can’t imagine why they
haven’t been forwarded.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia appeared a little dissatisfied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Was that
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></span> address?”</span> she
asked, suddenly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perfectly,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“as real as Pentonville Jail or
the House of Commons.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“And as likely to find me,”</span>
he added to himself.)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia seemed to hesitate whether to pursue the
subject further, but in the middle of her debate Mr Bunker
asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“By the way, has Lady Grillyer any recollection
of having seen me before?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, she doesn’t remember you at all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then we shall meet as strangers?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I think it would be better; don’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It will save our imaginations certainly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia looked at him as though she expected
something more; but as nothing came, she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think
it’s time I went back.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For the present then <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">au
revoir</span></span>, my dear Alicia. I
beg your pardon, Lady Alicia; it was that rascal Beveridge
who made the slip. It now remains to make your
formal acquaintance.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You—you mustn’t try!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The deuce is in these people beginning with B!”</span>
he laughed. <span class="tei tei-q">“They seem to do things without trying.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pressed her hand, raised his hat, and started back
to the town. She, on her part, lingered to let him get a
clear start of her, and her blue eyes looked as though a
breeze had blown across and ruffled them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker had reached the esplanade, and was
sauntering easily back towards the hotel, looking at the
people and smiling now and then to himself, when he
observed with considerable astonishment two familiar figures
strolling towards him. They were none other than
the Baron and the Countess, engaged in animated conversation,
and apparently on the very best terms with each
other. At the sight of him the Baron beamed joyfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Aha, Bonker, so you haf returned!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
ze meanvile I haf had vun great good fortune. Let me
present my friend Mr Bonker, ze Lady Grillyer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess bowed most graciously, and raising a
pair of tortoise-shell-rimmed eye-glasses mounted on a
stem of the same material, looked at Mr Bunker through
these with a by no means disapproving glance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight it was evident that Lady Alicia must
<span class="tei tei-q">“take after”</span> her noble father. The Countess was
aquiline of nose, large of person, and emphatic in her
voice and manner.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are the <span class="tei tei-q">‘showman,’</span> Mr Bunker, are you not?”</span>
she said, with a smile for which many of her acquaintances
would have given a tolerable percentage of their
incomes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It seems,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, smiling back agreeably,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that the Baron is now the showman, and I must
congratulate him on his first venture.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For an instant the Countess seemed a trifle taken aback.
It was a considerable number of years since she had
been addressed in precisely this strain, and in fact at
no time had her admirers ventured quite so dashingly to
the attack. But there was something entirely irresistible
in Mr Bunker’s manner, partly perhaps because he never
made the mistake of heeding a first rebuff. The Countess
coughed, then smiled a little again, and said to the Baron,
<span class="tei tei-q">“You didn’t tell me that your showman supplied the
little speeches as well.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I could not know it; zere has not before been ze reason
for a pretty speech,”</span> responded the Baron, gallantly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Lady Grillyer had been anybody else, one would
have said that she actually giggled. Certainly a little
wave of scandalised satisfaction rippled all over her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, really!”</span> she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t know which of you
is the worst offender.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this time, as may be imagined, Mr Bunker had
been in a state of high mystification at his friend’s unusual
adroitness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How the deuce did he get hold of her?”</span> he said to
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next pause the Baron solved the riddle.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You vil vunder, Bonker,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“how I did gom to
know ze Lady Grillyer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I envied, certainly,”</span> replied his friend, with a side
glance at the now purring Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“She vas of my introdogtions, bot till after you vent
out zis morning I did not lairn her name. Zen I said to
myself, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ze sun shines, Himmel is kind! Here now is ze
fair Lady Grillyer—my introdogtion!’</span> and zo zat is how,
you see.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To think of the Baron being here and our only finding
each other out by chance!”</span> said the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By a fortunate providence for me!”</span> exclaimed the
Baron, fervently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Baron,”</span> said the Countess, trying hard to look severe,
<span class="tei tei-q">“you must really keep some of these nice speeches for
my daughter. Which reminds me, I wonder where she
can be?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, here she goms!”</span> cried the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why, how did you know her?”</span> asked the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I did see her last night at dinnair,”</span> explained the
Baron, turning red.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, of course, I remember,”</span> replied the Countess,
in a matter-of-fact tone; but her motherly eye was sharp,
and already it began to look on the highly eligible Rudolph
with more approval than ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My daughter Alicia, the Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg,
Mr Bunker,”</span> she said the next moment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron went nearly double as he bowed, and the
flourish of his hat stirred the dust on the esplanade. Mr
Bunker’s salutation was less profound, but his face expressed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an almost equal degree of interested respect.
Her mother thought that when one of the gentlemen was
a nobleman with an indefinite number of thousands
a-year and the other a person of so much discrimination,
Lady Alicia’s own bow might have been a trifle less
reserved. But then even the most astute mother cannot
know the reasons for everything.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alicia,”</span> said the Countess, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was really a most
fortunate coincidence our meeting the Baron at St Egbert’s.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She paused for a reply and looked expectantly at her
daughter. It was not the first time in the course of the
morning that Lady Alicia had listened to similar observations,
and perhaps that was why she answered somewhat
listlessly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, wasn’t it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess frowned, and continued with emphasis,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I consider him one of the most agreeable and best
informed young men I have ever met.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is he?”</span> said Lady Alicia, absently.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder, Alicia, you hadn’t noticed it,”</span> her mother
observed, severely; <span class="tei tei-q">“you talked with him most of the
afternoon. I should have thought that no observant,
well-bred girl would have failed to have been struck with
his air and conversation.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I thought him very pleasant, mamma.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am glad you had so much sense. He
is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">extremely</span></span>
pleasant.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Lady Alicia made no reply, the Countess felt obliged
to continue his list of virtues herself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He is of most excellent family, Alicia, one of the
oldest in Bavaria. I don’t remember what I heard his
income was in pfennigs, or whatever they measure money
by in Germany, but I know that it is more than £20,000
a-year in English money. A very large sum nowadays,”</span>
she added, as if £20,000 had grown since she was a
girl.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, mamma.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He is considered, besides, an unusually promising
and intelligent young nobleman, and in Germany, where
noblemen are still constantly used, that says a great deal
for him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does it, mamma?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly it does. Education there is so severe that
young Englishmen are beginning to know less than they
ever did, and in most cases that isn’t saying much. Compare
the Baron with the young men you meet here!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked at her daughter triumphantly, and Alicia
could only reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, mamma?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Compare them and see the difference. Look at the
Baron’s friend, Mr Bunker, who is a very agreeable and
amusing man, I admit, but look at the difference!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What is it?”</span> Alicia could not help asking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></span> is it, Alicia!
It is—ah—it’s—er—it is, in
short, the effect of a carefully cultivated mind and good
blood.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But don’t you think Mr Bunker cultivated,
mamma—and—and—well-bred?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He has an amusing way of saying things,—but then
you must remember that the Baron is doubtless equally
entertaining in his native language,—and possibly a
superficial knowledge of a few of the leading questions
of the day; but the Baron talked to me for half an hour
on the relations of something or other in Germany
to—er—something else—a very important point,
I assure you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I always thought him very clever,”</span> said Lady Alicia
with a touch of warmth, and then instantly changed
colour at the horrible slip.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You always,”</span> said the Countess in alarmed astonishment;
<span class="tei tei-q">“you hardly spoke to him yesterday, and—had
you met him before?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—I meant the Baron, mamma.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I have just been saying that he
was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unusually</span></span>
clever.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I thought, I mean it seemed as though you considered
him only well informed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia’s blushes and confusion deepened. Her
mother looked at her with a softening eye. Suddenly
she rose, kissed her affectionately, and said with the tenderness
of triumph, <span class="tei tei-q">“My <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dear</span></span> girl!
Of course he is; clever, well informed, and a
most <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">desirable</span></span> young man.
My Alicia could not do&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She stopped, as if she thought this was perhaps a little
premature (though the Countess’s methods inclined to
the summary and decisive), and again kissing her daughter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
affectionately, remarked gaily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see, why, it’s
almost time we went for our little walk! We mustn’t
really disappoint those young men. I am in the middle
of such an amusing discussion with Mr Bunker, who is
really a very sensible man and quite worthy of the Baron’s
judgment.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Lady Alicia hardly knew whether to feel more
relieved at her escape or dismayed at the construction put
upon her explanation. She went out to meet the Baron,
determined to give no further colour to her mother’s
unlucky misconception. The Countess was far too experienced
and determined a general to leave it at all
doubtful who should walk by whose side, and who should
have the opportunity of appreciating whose merits, but
Lady Alicia was quite resolved that the Baron’s blandishments
should fall on stony ground.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a soft heart and an undecided mouth are treacherous
companions. The Baron was so amiable and so
gallant, that at the end of half an hour she was obliged
to abate the strictness of her resolution. She should
treat him with the friendliness of a brother. She learned
that he had no sisters: her decision was confirmed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The enamoured and delighted Baron was in the seventh
heaven of happy loquacity. He poured out particulars
of his travels, his more recordable adventures, his opinions
on various social and political matters, and at last even
of the family ghost, the hereditary carpet-beatership,
and the glories of Bavaria. And Lady Alicia listened
with what he could not doubt was an interest touched
with tenderness.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder,”</span> she said, artlessly, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you find anything
to admire in England—compared with Bavaria,
I mean.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two zings I haf not zere,”</span> replied the Baron, waving
his hand round towards the horizon. <span class="tei tei-q">“Vun is ze vet
sheet of flowing sea—says not your poet so? Ze ozzer”</span>
(laying his hand on his heart) <span class="tei tei-q">“is ze Lady Alicia à Fyre.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some people who catch sentiment whenever
it happens to be in the air, just as others almost equally
unfortunate regularly take hay-fever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia’s reply was much softer than she intended,
especially as she could have told anybody that the Baron’s
compliment was the merest figure of speech.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You needn’t have included me: I’m
sure <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I’m</span></span> not a
great attraction.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze sea is less, so zat leaves none,”</span> the Baron smiled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Didn’t you see anybody—I mean, anything in London
that attracted you—that you liked?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zat I liked, yes, zat pairhaps for the moment attracted
me; but not zat shall still attract me ven I am
gone avay.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron sighed this time, and she felt impelled to
reply, with the most sisterly kindness, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—we should,
of course, like to think that you didn’t forget
us <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">altogether</span></span>.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You need not fear.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Lady Alicia began to realise that this was more
like a second cousin than a brother, and with sudden
sprightliness she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder where that steamer’s
going!”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron turned his eyes towards his first-named
attraction, but for a professed lover of the ocean his
interest appeared slight. He only replied absently,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, zo?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little way behind them walked Mr Bunker and the
Countess. The attention of Lady Grillyer was divided
between the agreeable conversation of her companion
and the pleasant spectacle of a fabulous number of
pfennigs a-year bending its titled head over her daughter.
In the middle of one of Mr Bunker’s most amusing
stories she could not forbear interrupting with a complacent
<span class="tei tei-q">“they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> make a very
handsome couple!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker politely stopped his narrative, and looked
critically from his friend’s gaily checked back to Lady
Alicia’s trim figure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pray go on with your story, Mr Bunker,”</span> said the
Countess, hastily, realising that she had thought a little
too loudly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They are like,”</span> responded Mr Bunker, replying to
her first remark—<span class="tei tei-q">“they are like a pair of gloves.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess raised her brows and looked at him
sharply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I mean, of course, the best quality.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think,”</span> said the Countess, suspiciously, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you
spoke a little carelessly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My simile was a little premature?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think so,”</span> said the Countess, decisively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let us call them then an odd pair,”</span> smiled Mr Bunker,
unruffled; <span class="tei tei-q">“and only hope that they’ll turn out to be the
same size and different hands.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess actually condescended to smile back.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“She is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dear</span></span>
child,”</span> she murmured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His income, I think, is sufficient,”</span> he answered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Humour was not conspicuous in the Grillyer family.
The Countess replied seriously, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am one of those out-of-date
people, Mr Bunker, who consider some things
come before money, but the Baron’s birth and position
are fortunately unimpeachable.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“While his mental qualities,”</span> said Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“are,
in my experience, almost unique.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess was confirmed in her opinion of Mr
Bunker’s discrimination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Late that night, after they had parted with their friends,
the Baron smoked in the most unwonted silence while
Mr Bunker dozed on the sofa. Several times Rudolph
threw restive glances at his friend, as if he had something
on his mind that he needed a helping hand to unburden
himself of. At last the silence grew so intolerable that
he screwed up his courage and with desperate resolution
exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker opened his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker, I am in loff!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker smiled and stretched himself out again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have also been in love,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are not now?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! no.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vy alas?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because follies <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></span>
illusions get so infernally dull, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron smiled a little foolishly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I haf ze illusions, I fear.”</span> Then he broke out
enthusiastically, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, bot is she not lofly, Bonker?
If she will bot lof me back I shall be ze happiest man
out of heaven!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have wasted no time, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron shook his head in melancholy pleasure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are quite sure it is really love this time?”</span> his
friend pursued.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Qvite!”</span> said the Baron, with the firmness of a martyr.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There are so many imitations.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not so close zat zey can deceive!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> laughed Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“These first
symptoms are common to them all, and yet the varieties
of the disease are almost beyond counting. I myself
have suffered from it in eight different forms. There
was the virulent, spotted-all-over variety, known as
calf-love; there was the kind that accompanied itself by
a course of the Restoration dramatists; another form I
may call the strayed-Platonic, and that may be subdivided
into at least two; then there was&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Schtop! schtop!”</span> cried the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!
Zat will do! Teufel! I most examine my heart strictly.
And yet, Bonker, I zink my loff is anozzer kind—ze
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">real!</span></span>”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They are all that, Baron; but have it your own way.
Anything I can do to make you worse shall be done.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zanks, my best of friends,”</span> said the Baron, warmly,
seizing his hand; <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew you would stand by me!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker gave a little laugh, and returning the pressure,
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow, I’d do anything to oblige
a friend in such an interesting condition.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron was a few minutes late in joining the party
at lunch, and when he appeared he held an open letter
in his hand. It was only the middle of the next day,
and yet he could have sworn that last night he was comparatively
whole-hearted, he felt so very much more in
love already.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yet anozzer introdogtion has found me out,”</span> he said
as he took his seat. <span class="tei tei-q">“I have here a letter of invitation
vich I do not zink I shall accept.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He threw an amorous glance at Lady Alicia, which
her watchful mother rightly interpreted as indicating
the cause of his intended refusal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who is it this time?”</span> asked Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sir Richard Brierley of Brierley Park, Dampshire.
Is zat how you pronounce it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sir Richard Brierley!”</span> exclaimed the Countess;
<span class="tei tei-q">“why, Alicia and I are going to visit some relatives of
ours who live only six miles from Brierley Park! When
has he asked you, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze end of next week.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How odd! We are going down to Dampshire at the
end of next week too. You must accept, Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall!”</span> exclaimed the overjoyed Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall
ve go, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m not asked, I’m afraid.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, bot zat is nozzing. I shall tell him.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As you please, Baron,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, with a
half glance at Lady Alicia.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The infatuated Baron had already begun to dread the
inevitable hour of separation, and this piece of good
fortune put him into the highest spirits. He felt so amiable
towards the whole world that when the four went out
for a stroll in the afternoon he lingered for a minute by
Lady Grillyer’s side, and in that minute Mr Bunker and
Lady Alicia were out of hail ahead. The Baron’s face
fell.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I come down to this place?”</span> said Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Would you like to?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should be sorry,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“to part with—the
Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia had expected a slightly different ending
to this sentence, and so, to tell the truth, Mr Bunker had
intended.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, if you can’t stay away from the Baron, you had
better go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is certainly very hard to tear myself away from so
charming a person as the Baron; perhaps you can feel
for me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think he is very—nice.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He thinks you very nice.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does he?”</span> said Lady Alicia, with great indifference,
and a moment later changed the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the Baron was growing very uneasy. Of
course it was quite natural that Mr Bunker should find
it pleasant to walk for a few minutes by the side of the
fairest creature on earth, and very possibly he was artfully
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pleading his friend’s cause. Yet the Baron felt uneasy.
He remembered Mr Bunker’s invariable success with
the gentler sex, his wit, his happy smile, and his good
looks; and he began to wish most sincerely that these
fascinations were being exercised on the now somewhat
breathless Countess, for his efforts to overtake the pair
in front had both annoyed and exhausted Lady Grillyer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Need we walk quite so fast, Baron?”</span> she suggested;
and Lady Grillyer’s suggestions were of the kind that are
evidently meant to be acted upon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, I did forged,”</span> said the Baron, absently, and
without further remark he slackened his pace for a few
yards and then was off again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You were telling me,”</span> gasped the Countess, <span class="tei tei-q">“of something
you thought of—doing when—you went—home.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zo? Oh yes, it vas—Teufel! I do not remember.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Really, Baron,”</span> said the Countess, decidedly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
cannot go any farther at this rate. Let us turn. The
others will be turning too, in a minute.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact the unlucky Baron had clean run Lady Grillyer’s
maternal instincts off their feet, and he suffered
for it by seeing nothing of either his friend or his charmer
for an hour and a half.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That night he accepted Sir Richard’s invitation, but
said nothing whatever about bringing a friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the next week Rudolph was in as many states of
mind as there were hours in each day. He walked and
rode and drove with Lady Alicia through the most romantic
spots he could find. He purchased a large assortment
of golf-clubs, and under her tuition essayed to play
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that most dangerous of games for mixed couples. In
turn he broke every club in his set; the cavities he hewed
in the links are still pointed out to the curious; but the
heart of the Lady Alicia alone he seemed unable to
damage. There was always a moment at which his
courage failed him, and in that fatal pause she invariably
changed the subject with the most innocent air in the
world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every now and then the greenest spasms of jealousy
would seize him. Why did she elect to disappear with
Mr Bunker on the very morning that he had resolved
should settle his fate? It is true he had made the same
resolution every morning, but on this particular one
he had no doubt he would have put his fate to the touch.
And why on a certain moonlight evening was he left to
the unsentimental company of the Countess?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He made no further reference to the visit to Brierley
Park; in fact he shunned discussion of any kind with
his quondam bosom friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time slipped past, till the visit to St Egbert’s was
almost at an end. On the day after to-morrow all four
were going to leave (where Mr Bunker was going, his
friend never troubled to inquire).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They sat together latish in the evening in the Baron’s
room. That very afternoon Lady Alicia had spent more
time in Mr Bunker’s society than in his, and the Baron
felt that the hour had come for an explanation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bonker, I haf a suspection!”</span> he exclaimed, suddenly.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is not I, bot you, who are ze friend to ze beautiful
Lady Alicia. You are not doing me fair!”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is so: you are not doing me fair,”</span> the Baron reiterated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is you are
so much in love that you have lost your wonted courage.
You don’t use your chances.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I do not get zem.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nonsense, Baron! I haven’t spent one hour in Lady
Alicia’s company to your twenty-four, and yet if I’d
been matrimonially inclined I could have proposed twice
over. You’ve had the chance of being accepted fifty
times.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I haf not been accepted vunce,”</span> said the Baron,
moodily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you put the question?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I haf not dared.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, my dear Baron, whose fault is that?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron was silent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ask her to-morrow.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, Bonker,”</span> said the Baron, sadly; <span class="tei tei-q">“she treats me
not like a lover. She talks of friendship. I do not vish
a frient!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker looked thoughtfully up at the ceiling.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You don’t think you have touched her heart?”</span> he
asked at length.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I fear not.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must try an infallible recipe for winning a
woman’s heart. You must be in trouble.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In trouble!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have tried it once myself, with great success.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot how?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must fall ill.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot I cannot; I am too healthful, alas!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker smiled artfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“They come to tea in
our rooms to-morrow, you know. By then, Baron, you
must be laid up, ill or not, just as you please. A grain
of Lady Alicia’s sympathy is worth more than a ton of
even your wit.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The standard chosen for the measurement of his wit
escaped the Baron, the scheme delighted him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, Bonker! schön! I tvig! Goot!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“How
shall ve do?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Leave it to me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron reflected, and his smile died away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sopposing,”</span> he said, slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“zey find out? Is it
vise? Is it straight?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They can’t find out. They go the next morning,
and what’s to prevent your making a quick recovery and
pluckily going down to Brierley Park as the interesting
convalescent? She will know that you’ve made a dangerous
journey on her account.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron’s face cleared again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let us try!”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“anyzing is better zan my present
state. Bot, be careful, Bonker!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall take the most minute precautions,”</span> replied
Mr Bunker.</p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning the two conspirators breakfasted
early. The Baron seemed a little nervous now that it
came so near the venture, but his friend was as cheerful
as a schoolboy, and his confident air soon put fresh courage
into Rudolph.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker’s bedroom opened out of their common
sitting-room, and so he declared that in the afternoon
the Baron must be laid up there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Keep your room all morning,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and look as
pale as you can. I shall make my room ready for you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Baron had retired, he threw himself into a
chair and gazed for a few minutes round his bedroom.
Then he rang his bell, ordered the servant to make the
bed immediately, and presently went out to do some
shopping. On the way he sent word to the Countess,
telling her only that the Baron was indisposed, but that
in spite of this misfortune he hoped he should have the
pleasure of their company at tea. The rest of the morning
he spent in his bedroom, prudently keeping out of
the ladies’ way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, after a substantial lunch which he insisted
upon getting up to eat, the Baron was allowed to enter
the sick-room, he uttered an exclamation of astonishment,—and
indeed his surprise was natural. The room
was as full of flowers as a conservatory; chairs, wardrobe,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and fireplace were most artistically draped with art
hangings; a plate filled with grapes, a large bottle labelled
<span class="tei tei-q">“Two table-spoonfuls every half hour,”</span> and a medicine-glass
were placed conspicuously on a small table; and,
most remarkable feature of all, Mr Bunker’s bath filled
with water and alive with goldfish stood by the side of
the bed. A couple of canaries sang in a cage by the
window, the half-drawn curtains only permitted the most
delicate light to steal into the room, and in short the
whole arrangement reflected the utmost credit on his
ingenious friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron was delighted, but a little puzzled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat for are zese fishes and ze canaries?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To show your love of nature.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vy so?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There is nothing that pleases a woman more.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, you zink of everyzing!”</span> exclaimed the
Baron, admiringly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When four o’clock approached he drew a night-shirt
over his other garments and got into bed. Mr Bunker
at first was in favour of a complete change of attire, but
on his friend’s expostulating against such a thorough
precaution, he admitted that it would be perhaps rather
like the historic blacking of Othello.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Leave it all to me, my dear Baron,”</span> he said, reassuringly,
as he tucked him in; and with that he went into
the other room and awaited the arrival of their guests.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They came punctually. The Countess was full of
concern for the <span class="tei tei-q">“dear Baron,”</span> while Lady Alicia, he
could not help thinking, appeared unusually reserved.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In fact, his quick eye soon divined that something was
the matter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“She has either been getting a lecture from the dowager
or has found something
out<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E4" id="E4" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e4" class="tei tei-ref">,</a></span>”</span>
he said to himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, it seemed that if she had found anything
out it could have nothing to do with the Baron’s indisposition,
for she displayed the most ingenuous sympathy,
and, he thought, she even appeared to aim it pointedly at
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So sudden!”</span> exclaimed the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is rather sudden, but we’ll hope it may pass as
quickly as it came,”</span> said Mr Bunker, conveying a skilful
impression of deep concern veiled by a cheerful manner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me honestly, Mr Bunker, is it dangerous?”</span>
demanded the countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker hesitated, gave a half-hearted laugh, and
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, dear, no! that is—at present, Lady Grillyer,
we have really no reason to be alarmed.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">so</span></span> sorry,”</span>
murmured Lady Alicia.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her mother looked at her approvingly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Poor Baron!”</span> she said, in a tone of the greatest commiseration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So far from home!”</span> sighed Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“And yet
so cheerful through it all,”</span> he added.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What did you say was the matter?”</span> asked the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker had thought it both wiser and more effective
to maintain a little mystery round his friend’s malady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The doctor hasn’t yet given a decided opinion,”</span> he
replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can’t we do anything?”</span> said Lady Alicia, softly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker thought the guests were nearly worked up
to the proper pitch of sympathy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Poor Rudolph!”</span> he exclaimed. <span class="tei tei-q">“It would cheer
him immensely, I know, and ease my own anxiety as
well, if you would venture in to see him for a few minutes.
In such a case there is no sympathy so welcome as a
woman’s.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess glanced at her daughter, and wavered
for an instant between those proprieties for which she
was a famous stickler and this admirable chance of completing
the Baron’s conquest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His relations are far away,”</span> said Mr Bunker, looking
pensively out of the window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We might come in for a few minutes, Alicia?”</span> suggested
Lady Grillyer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, mamma,”</span> replied Lady Alicia, with an alacrity
that rather surprised their host.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a pleasantly dejected air he ushered the ladies
into the darkened sick-room. The Baron, striving to
conceal his exultation under a rueful semblance, greeted
them with a languid yet happy smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, Lady Grillyer, zis is kind indeed! And you,
Lady Alicia, how can I zank you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My daughter and I are much distressed, Baron, to
find our host <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hors de
combat</span></span>,”</span> said the Countess, graciously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just when you wanted to go away too!”</span> added Lady
Alicia, sympathetically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron emitted a happy blend of sigh and groan.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is hard indeed.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must hurry up and get better,”</span> said the Countess,
in her most cheering sick-room manner. <span class="tei tei-q">“It won’t do
to disappoint the Brierleys, you know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must come down for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">part</span></span>
of the time,”</span> smiled her daughter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These expressions of sympathy so affected the Baron
that he placed his hand on his brow and turned slightly
away to conceal his emotion. At the same time Mr
Bunker, with well-timed dramatic effect, sank wearily
into a chair, and, laying his elbow on the back, hid his
own face in his hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their guests jumped to the most alarming conclusions,
and looked from one to the other with great concern.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dear me!”</span> said the Countess, <span class="tei tei-q">“surely it isn’t so very
serious, Mr Bunker; it isn’t
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infectious</span></span>, is it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unlucky Baron here made his first mistake: without
waiting for his more diplomatic friend to reply, he
answered hastily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, no, it is bot a cold.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Grillyer’s expression changed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A cold!”</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear me, that can’t be so very
serious, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a bad cold,”</span> said the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time the ladies’ eyes were growing more used
to the dim light, and Mr Bunker could see that they
were taking rapid stock of the garnishings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This, I suppose, is your cough-mixture,”</span> said the
Countess, examining the bottle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron incautiously admitted it was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Two table-spoonfuls every half hour!”</span> she exclaimed;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“why, I never heard of taking a cough-mixture in such
doses. Besides, your cough doesn’t seem so very bad,
Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze doctor told me to take it so,”</span> replied the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess turned towards Mr Bunker and said,
with a touch of suspicion in her voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought, Mr
Bunker, the doctor had given no opinion.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron threw a glance of intense ferocity at his
friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the Baron’s desire to spare your feelings,”</span> replied
Mr Bunker, gravely, <span class="tei tei-q">“he has been a little inaccurate;
that is not precisely an ordinary cough-mixture.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,”</span> said the Countess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lady Alicia’s attention had been strongly attracted
by the bath, and suddenly she exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, there
are goldfish in it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron’s nerve was fast deserting him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze doctor ordered zem,”</span> he began—<span class="tei tei-q">“I mean, I am
fond of fishes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess looked hard at the unhappy young man,
and then turned severely to his friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></span> is the matter
with the Baron?”</span> she demanded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker saw there was nothing for it but heroic
measures.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The dog was destroyed at once,”</span> he replied, with
intense gravity. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is therefore impossible to say exactly
what is the matter.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The dog!</span></span>”</span> cried
the two ladies together.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By this evening,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“we shall know the
worst—or the best.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span> exclaimed the Countess, withdrawing
a step from the bed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I mean,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, with a happy inspiration,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that this bath is a delicate test. No victim of the
dread disease of hydrophobia can bear to look&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Countess gave him no time to finish. Even
as he was speaking the Baron’s face had passed through
a series of the most extraordinary expressions, which she
not unnaturally put down to premonitory symptoms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s beginning already!”</span> she shrieked. <span class="tei tei-q">“Alicia, my
love, come quickly. How dare you expose us, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Calm yourselves. I assure you&mdash;&mdash;”</span> pleaded Mr
Bunker, coming hastily after them, but they were at the
door before him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hapless Baron could stand it no longer. Crying,
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, no, it is false!”</span> he sprang out of bed, arrayed in a
tweed suit only half concealed by his night-shirt, and,
forgetting all about the bath, descended with a great
splash among the startled goldfish.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess paused in the half-opened door and
looked at him with horror that rapidly passed into intense
indignation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am not ill!”</span> he cried. <span class="tei tei-q">“It vos zat rascal Bonker’s
plot. He made me! I haf not hydrophobia!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most unkindest cut of all, Lady Alicia went off into
hysterical giggles. For a moment her mother glared
at the two young men in silence, and then only remarking,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have never been so insulted before,”</span> she went
out, and her daughter followed her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the door closed Mr Bunker went off into roar after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
roar of laughter, but the humorous side of the situation
seemed to appeal very slightly to his injured friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You rascal! you villain!”</span> he shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“zis is ze end
of our friendship, Bonker! Do you use ze pistols? Tell
me, sare!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron,”</span> gasped Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“I could not
put such an inartistic end to so fine a joke for the
world.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You vill not fight? Coward! poltroon! I know not
ze English name bad enoff for you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With difficulty Mr Bunker composed himself and
replied, still smiling: <span class="tei tei-q">“After all, Baron, what harm has
been done? I get all the blame, and the sympathy you
wanted is sure to turn to you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“False friend!”</span> thundered the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron!”</span> said Mr Bunker, mildly, <span class="tei tei-q">“whose
fault was it that the plot miscarried? If you’d only left
it all to me&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Left it to you! Yes, I left too moch to you! Traitor,
it vas a trick to vin ze Lady Alicia for yourself! Speak
to me nevermore!”</span> And with that the infuriated nobleman
rushed off to his own room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As there was no further sign of him for the next half
hour, Mr Bunker, still smiling to himself at the recollection,
went out to take the air; but just as he was about to
descend the stairs he spied Lady Alicia lingering in a
passage. He turned back and went up to her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She began at once in a low, hurried voice that seemed
to have a strain of anger running beneath it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I got the two letters I wrote you returned to me to-day
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the dead-letter office. Nothing was known
about you at the address you gave.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am not surprised,”</span> he replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then it was false?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As an address it was perfectly genuine, only it didn’t
happen to be mine.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Were you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ever</span></span> in the Church?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not to my personal knowledge.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yet you said you were?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was in an asylum.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked up at him with fine contempt, while he
smiled back at her with great amusement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have deceived <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></span>,”</span>
she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and you have treated your other friend—who
is far too good for you—disgracefully.
Have you anything to say for yourself?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not a word,”</span> he replied, cheerfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></span> treat
me again as—as I let you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a smile played for an instant about his face, she
added quickly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">suppose</span></span> I shall ever see you
again. In future we are not
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">likely</span></span> to meet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The lady and the lunatic?”</span> said he. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, perhaps
not. Good-bye, and better luck.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye,”</span> she answered coldly, and added as they
parted, <span class="tei tei-q">“my mother, of course, is extremely angry with
you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There,”</span> he said with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“you see I still come in
useful.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She hurried away, and Mr Bunker walked slowly
downstairs and out of the hotel.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It seems to me,”</span> he reflected, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I shall have to
set out on my adventures again alone.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron’s natural good temper might have forgiven
his friend, but all night he was a prey to something against
which no temper is proof. The Baron was bitterly jealous.
All through breakfast he never spoke a word, and when
Mr Bunker asked him what train he intended to take,
he replied curtly, as he went to the door, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ze 5.30.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And where do you go now?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat is zat to you? I go for a valk. I vould be
alone.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye, then, Baron,”</span> said Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think
I shall go up to town.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Go, zen,”</span> replied the Baron, opening the door; <span class="tei tei-q">“I haf
no furzer vish to see a treacherous
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sponge</span></span> zat vill neizer
be true nor fight, bot jost takes money.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He slammed the door and went out. If he had waited
for a moment, he would have seen a look in Mr Bunker’s
face that he had never seen before. He half started
from his chair to follow, and then sat down again and
thought with his lips very tight set.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All at once they broke into a smile that was grimmer
than anything the Baron had known.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I accept your challenge, Baron Rudolph von Blitzenberg,”</span>
he said to himself; <span class="tei tei-q">“but the weapons I shall choose
myself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took a telegraph form, wrote and despatched a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wire, and then with considerable haste proceeded to
pack. Within an hour he had left the hotel.</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a servant, later in the day, was performing,
under the Baron’s directions, the same office for him,
a series of discoveries that still further disturbed his
peace of mind were jointly made. Not only the more
sporting portions of his wardrobe but his gun and cartridges
as well, had vanished, and, search and storm as
he liked, there was not a trace of them to be found.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze rascal!”</span> he muttered; <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not zink he was zief
as well.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is hardly wonderful that he arrived at Brierley
station in anything but an amiable frame of mind. There,
to his great annoyance and surprise, he found no signs
of Sir Richard’s carriage; there were no stables near,
and, after fuming for some time on the platform, he
was forced to leave his luggage with the station-master
and proceed on foot to Brierley Park.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He arrived shortly before seven o’clock, after a dark
and muddy tramp, and, still swearing under his breath,
pulled the bell with indignant energy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am ze Baron von Blitzenberg, bot zere vas no carriage
at ze station,”</span> he informed the butler in his haughtiest
tones.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Baron arrived this morning,”</span> he said.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze Baron? Vat Baron? I am ze Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall fetch Sir Richard,”</span> said the butler, turning
away.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently a stout florid gentleman, accompanied by
three friends, all evidently very curious and amused
about something, came to the door, and, to the poor
Baron’s amazement and horror, he recognised in one of
these none other than Mr Bunker, arrayed with much
splendour in his own ornate shooting suit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want?”</span> asked the florid gentleman,
sternly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have I ze pleasure of addressing Sir Richard Brierley?”</span>
inquired the Baron, raising his hat and bowing
profoundly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zen I must tell you zat I am ze Baron Rudolph von
Blitzenberg.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gom, gom, my man!”</span> interposed Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
know you. Zis man, Sir Richard, has before annoyed
me. He is vat you call impostor, cracked; he has vollowed
me from Germany. Go avay, man!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are impostor! You scoundrel, Bonker!”</span> shouted
the wrathful Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“He is no Baron, Sir Richard!
Ha! Vould you again deceive me, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must lock him up, I fear,”</span> said Mr Bunker.
<span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow, my man, you vill see ze police.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So completely did the Baron lose his head that he
became almost inarticulate with rage: his protestations,
however, were not of the slightest avail. That morning
Sir Richard had received a wire informing him that the
Baron was coming by an earlier train than he had originally
intended, and, since his arrival, the spurious nobleman
had so ingratiated himself with his host that Sir
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Richard was filled with nothing but sympathy for him
in his persecution. After a desperate struggle the unfortunate
Rudolph was overpowered and conveyed in
the undignified fashion known as the frog’s march to a
room in a remote wing, there to pass the night under
lock and key.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The scoundrelly German impostor!”</span> exclaimed a
young man, a fellow visitor of the Baron Bunker’s, to a
tall, military-looking gentleman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Colonel Savage seemed lost in thought.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is a curious thing, Trelawney,”</span> he replied, at
length, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the footman who attends the Baron should
have told my man—who, of course, told me—that a number
of his things are marked <span class="tei tei-q">‘Francis Beveridge.’</span> It is
also rather strange that this impostor should have known
so little of the Baron’s movements as to arrive several
hours after him, assuming he had hatched a plot to impersonate
him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But the man’s obviously mad.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Must be,”</span> said the colonel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house party were assembled in the drawing-room
waiting for dinner to be announced. The bogus Baron
was engaged in an animated discussion with Colonel
Savage on the subject of Bavarian shootings, and the
colonel having omitted to inform him that he had some
personal experience of these, Mr Bunker was serving
up such of his friend’s anecdotes as he could remember
with sauce more peculiarly his own.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Five hondred vild boars,”</span> he was saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“eight
hondred brace of partridges, many bears, and rabbits so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moch zat it took five veeks to bury zem. All zese ve did
shoot before breakfast, colonel. Aftair breakfast again
ve did go out&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But at that moment his attention was sharply arrested
by a question of Lady Brierley’s.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Has Dr Escott arrived?”</span> she asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron Bunker paused, and in spite of his habitual
coolness, the observant colonel noticed that he started
ever so slightly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He came half an hour ago,”</span> replied Sir Richard.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, here he is.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke, a well-remembered figure came into the
room, and after a welcome from his hostess, the dinner
procession started.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever is that tall fair man in front?”</span> Dr Escott
asked his partner as they crossed the hall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, that’s the Baron von Blitzenberg: such an amusing
man! We are all in love with him already.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All through dinner the spurious Baron saw that Dr
Escott’s eyes turned continually and curiously on him;
yet never for an instant did his spirits droop or his conversation
flag. Witty and charming as ever, he discoursed
in his comical foreign accent to the amusement
of all within hearing, and by the time the gentlemen
adjourned to the billiard-room, he had established the
reputation of being the most delightful German ever
seen. Yet Dr Escott grew more suspicious and bewildered,
and Mr Bunker felt that he was being narrowly
watched. The skill at billiards of a certain Francis
Beveridge used to be the object of the doctor’s unbounded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
admiration, and it was with the liveliest interest that he
watched a game between Colonel Savage and the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That nobleman knew well the danger of displaying
his old dexterity, and to the onlookers it soon became
apparent that this branch of his education had been
neglected. He not only missed the simplest shots, but
seemed very ignorant of the rules of the English game,
and in consequence he came in for a little good-natured
chaff from Sir Richard and Trelawney. When the
colonel’s score stood at 90 and the Baron had scarcely
reached 25 Trelawney cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll bet you ten to one you
don’t win, Baron!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What in?”</span> asked the Baron, and the colonel noticed
that for the first time be pronounced a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">w</span></span> correctly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sovereigns,”</span> said Trelawney, gaily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temptation was irresistible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Done!”</span> said the Baron. With a professional disregard
for conventions he bolted the white into the middle
pocket, leaving his own ball nicely beside the red. Down
in its turn went the red, and Mr Bunker was on the spot.
Three followed three in monotonous succession, Trelawney’s
face growing longer and Dr Escott getting more
and more excited, till with a smile Mr Bunker laid down
his cue, a sensational winner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His victory was received in silence: Trelawney handed
over two five-pound notes without a word, and the colonel
returned to his whisky-and-soda. Dr Escott could contain
himself no longer, and whispering something to Sir
Richard, the two left the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imperturbable as ever, Mr Bunker talked gaily for a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
few minutes to an unresponsive audience, and then,
remarking that he would join the ladies, left the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A minute or two later Sir Richard, with an anxious
face, returned with Dr Escott.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where is the Baron?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gone to join the ladies,”</span> replied Trelawney, adding
under his breath, <span class="tei tei-q">“d&mdash;&mdash; n him!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Baron was not with the ladies, nor, search the
house as they might, was there a trace to be seen of that
accomplished nobleman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He has gone!”</span> said Sir Richard.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What the deuce is the meaning of it?”</span> exclaimed
Trelawney.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Colonel Savage smiled grimly and suggested, <span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps
he wants to give the impostor an innings.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dr Escott, I think, can tell you,”</span> replied the baronet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Gentlemen,”</span> said the doctor, <span class="tei tei-q">“the man whom you
have met as the Baron von Blitzenberg is none other
than a most cunning and determined lunatic. He escaped
from the asylum where I am at present assistant doctor,
after all but murdering me; he has been seen in London
since, but how he came to impersonate the unfortunate
gentleman whom you locked up this afternoon I cannot
say.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before they broke up for the night the genuine Baron,
released from confinement and soothed by the humblest
apologies and a heavy supper, recounted the main events
in Mr Beveridge <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alias</span></span>
Bunker’s brief career in town.
On his exploits in St Egbert’s he felt some delicacy in
touching, but at the end of what was after all only a

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The party at Brierley Park had gone at last to bed.
The Baron was installed in his late usurper’s room, and
from the clock-tower the hour of three had just been
tolled. Sympathy and Sir Richard’s cellar had greatly
mollified the Baron’s wrath; he had almost begun to see
the humorous side of his late experience; as a rival Mr
Bunker was extinct, and with an easy mind and a placid
smile he had fallen asleep some two hours past.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fire burned low, and for long nothing but the
occasional sigh of the wind in the trees disturbed the
silence. At length, had the Baron been awake, he might
have heard the stealthiest of footsteps in the corridor
outside. Then they stopped; his door was gently opened,
and first a head and then a whole man slipped in.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the Baron slept, dreaming peacefully of his late
companion. They were driving somewhere in a hansom,
Mr Bunker was telling one of his most amusing stories,
when there came a shock, the hansom seemed to turn a
somersault, and the Baron awoke. At first he thought
he must be dreaming still; the electric light had been
turned on and the room was bright as day, but, more
bewildering yet, Mr Bunker was seated on his bed, gazing
at him with an expression of thoughtful amusement.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Baron,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I trust you are comfortable
in these excellent quarters.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron, half awake and wholly astonished, was
unable to collect his ideas in time to make any reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But remember,”</span> continued Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have
a reputation to live up to. I have set the standard high
for Bavarian barons.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The indignant Baron at last recovered his wits.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“If you do not go away <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at
vonce</span></span>,”</span> he said, raising himself
on his elbows, <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall raise ze house upon you!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you forgotten that you are talking to a dangerous
lunatic, who probably never stirs without his razor?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron looked at him and turned a little pale. He
made no further movement, but answered stoutly enough,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Vat do you vant?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the first place, I want my brush and comb, a few
clothes, and my hand-bag. Events happened rather more
quickly this evening than I had anticipated.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take zem.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should also like,”</span> continued Mr Bunker, unmoved,
<span class="tei tei-q">“to have a little talk with you. I think I owe you some
explanation—perhaps an apology or two—and I’m afraid
it’s my last chance.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zay it zen.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Of course I understand that you make no hostile
demonstration till I am finished? A hunted man must
take precautions, you know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I vill let you go.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker folded his arms, leaned his back against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the foot of the bed, and began in his half-bantering way,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have amused you, Baron, now and then, you must
admit?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron made no reply.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That I place to my credit, and I think few debts are
better worth repaying. On the other hand, I confess I
have subsisted for some time entirely on your kindness.
I’m afraid that alone counterbalances the debt, and
when it comes to my being the means of your taking a
bath in mixed company and spending an evening in a
locked room, there’s no doubt the balance is greatly on
your side.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I zink so,”</span> observed the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So I’ll tell you a true story, a favour with which I
haven’t indulged any one for some considerable time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron coughed, but said nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My biography for all practical purposes,”</span> Mr Bunker
continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“begins in that sequestered retreat, Clankwood
Asylum. How and with whom I came there I
haven’t the very faintest recollection. I simply woke up
from an extraordinary drowsiness to find myself recovering
from a sharp attack of what I may most euphoniously
call mental excitement. The original cause of it is very
dim in my mind, and has, so far as I remember, nothing
to do with the rest of the story. The attack was very
short, I believe. I soon came to something more or less
like myself; only, Baron, the singular thing is, that it was
to all intents and purposes a new self—whether better
or worse, my faulty memory does not permit me to say.
I’d clean forgotten who I was and all about me. I found
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
myself called Francis Beveridge, but that wasn’t my old
name, I know.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> exclaimed the Baron, growing interested despite
himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And the most remarkable thing of all is that up till
this day I haven’t the very vaguest notion what my real
name is.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zo?”</span> said the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bot vy should they change it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There you’ve laid your finger on the mystery, Baron.
Why? Heaven knows: I wish I did!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron looked at him with undisguised interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Strange!”</span> he said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Damnably strange. I found myself compelled to
live in an asylum and answer to a new name, and really,
don’t you know, under the circumstances I could give no
very valid reason for getting out. I seemed to have
blossomed there like one of the asylum plants. I couldn’t
possibly have been more identified with the place. Besides,
I’m free to confess that for some time my reason,
taking it all in all, wasn’t particularly valid on any point.
By George, I had a funny time! Ha, ha, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His mirth was so infectious that the Baron raised his
voice in a hearty <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha!”</span> and then stopped abruptly,
and said cautiously, <span class="tei tei-q">“Haf a care, Bonker, zey may hear!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“However, Baron,”</span> Mr Bunker continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“out I
was determined to get, and out I came in the manner
of which perhaps my friend Escott has already informed
you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron grinned and nodded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I came up to town, and on my very first evening I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had the good fortune to meet the Baron Rudolph von
Blitzenberg—as perhaps you may remember. In my
own defence, Baron, I may fairly plead that since I could
remember nothing about my past career, I was entitled
to supply the details from my imagination. After all,
I have no proof that some of my stories may not have
been correct. I used this privilege freely in Clankwood,
and, in a word, since I couldn’t tell the truth if I wanted
to, I quenched the desire.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You hombog!”</span> said the Baron, not without a note of
admiration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was, and I gloried in it. Baron, if you ever want to
know how ample a thing life can be, become a certified
lunatic! You are quite irresponsible for your debts,
your crimes, and, not least, your words. It certainly
enlarges one’s horizon. All this time, I may say, I was
racking my brains—which, by the way, have been steadily
growing saner in other matters—for some recollections
of my previous whereabouts, my career, if I had any,
and, above all, of my name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Can you remember nozing?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can remember a large country house which I think
belonged to me, but in what part of the country it stands
I haven’t the slightest recollection. I can’t remember
any family, and as no one has inquired for me, I don’t
suppose I had any. Many incidents—sporting, festive,
amusing, and discreditable—I remember distinctly, and
many faces, but there’s nothing to piece them together
with. Can you recall one or two incidents in town,
when people spoke to me or bowed to me?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, vell; I vondered zen.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose they knew me. In a general sort of way I
knew them. But when a man doesn’t know his own
name, and will probably be replaced in an asylum if he’s
identified, there isn’t much encouragement for greeting
old friends. And do you remember my search for a
name in the hotel at St Egbert’s?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yah—zat is, yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was for my own I was looking.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You found it not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No. The worst of it is, I can’t even remember what
letter it began with. Sometimes I think it was M, or
perhaps N, and sometimes I’m almost sure it was E. It
will come to me some day, no doubt, Baron, but till it
does I shall have to wander about a nameless man, looking
for it. And after all, I am not without the consolations
of a certain useful, workaday kind of philosophy.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rose from the bed and smiled humorously at his
friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now, Baron,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it only remains to offer
you such thanks and apologies as a lunatic may, and
then clear out before the cock crows. These are my
brushes, I think.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was still something on the Baron’s mind: he lay
for a moment watching Mr Bunker collect a few odds
and ends and put them rapidly into a small bag, and
then blurted out suddenly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ze Lady Alicia—do you
loff her?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By Jove!”</span> exclaimed Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’d forgotten all
about her. I ought to have told you that I once met her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before, when she showed sympathy—practical sympathy,
I may add—for an unfortunate gentleman in Clankwood.
That’s all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You do not loff her?”</span> persisted the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I, my dear chap? No. You are most welcome to
her—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> the countess.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Does she not loff you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“On my honour, no. I told her a few early reminiscences;
she happened to discover they were not what is
generally known as true, and took so absurd a view of
the case that I doubt whether she would speak to me
again if she met me. In fact, Baron, if I read the omens
aright—and I’ve had some experience—you only need
courage and a voice.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bed creaked, there was a volcanic upheaval of
the clothes as the Baron sprang out on to the floor, and
the next instant Mr Bunker was clasped in his embrace.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, my own Bonker, forgif me! I haf suspected,
I haf not been ze true friend; you have sairved me right
to gom here as ze Baron. I vas too bad a Baron to gom!
You have amused me, you have instrogted, you have
varmed my heart. My dear frient!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To tell the truth, Mr Bunker looked, for the first time
in their acquaintance, a little ill at ease. He laughed,
but it sounded affected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow—hang it! You’d make me out a
martyr. As a matter of fact, I’ve been such a thorn as
very few people would stand in their flesh. There’s
nothing to forgive, my dear Baron, and a lot to thank
you for.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I haf been rude, Bonker; I haf insulted you! You
forgif me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With all my heart, if you think it’s needed, but&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And you vill not go now? You vill stay here?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What, two Barons at once? My dear chap, we’d
merely confuse the butler.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, you vill joke, you hombog! But you most
stay!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And what about my friend, Dr Escott? No, Baron,
it would only mean breakfast and the next train to Clankwood.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zey vill not take you ven you tell zem! I shall insist
viz Sir Richard!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The law is the law, Baron, and I’m a certified lunatic.
Here we must part till the weather clears; and mind, you
mustn’t say a word about my coming to see you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron looked at him disconsolately.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You most really go, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Really, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And vere to?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“To London town again by the milk train.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And vat vill you do zere?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Look for my name.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bot how?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have a little clue,”</span> he said at last, <span class="tei tei-q">“only a thread,
but I’ll try it for what it’s worth.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Haf you money enoff?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks to your generosity and my skill at billiards,
yes, which reminds me that I must return poor Trelawney’s
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ten pounds some day. At present, I can’t
afford to be scrupulous. So, you see, I’m provided
for.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Cigars at least, Bonker! You most smoke, my frient
vizout a name!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron, night-shirted and barefooted as he was,
dived into his portmanteau and produced a large box of
cigars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You like zese, Bonker. Zey are your own choice.
Smoke zem and zink of me!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A few, Baron, would be a pleasant reminiscence,”</span>
said his friend, with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you really insist.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All, Bonker,—I vill not keep vun! I can get more.
No, you most take zem all!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker opened his bag and put in the box without
a word.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You most write,”</span> said the Baron, <span class="tei tei-q">“tell me vere you
are. I shall not tell any soul, bot ven I can, I shall gom
up, and ve shall sup togezzer vunce more. Pairhaps ve
may haf anozzer adventure, ha, ha!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron’s laugh was almost too hearty to be true.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall let you know, as soon as I find a room. It
won’t be in the Mayonaise this time! Good-bye: good
sport and luck in love!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye, my frient, good-bye,”</span> said the Baron,
squeezing his hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His friend was half out of the door when he turned,
and said with an intonation quite foreign either to Beveridge
or Bunker, and yet which came very pleasantly,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I forgot to warn you of one thing when I advised you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to try the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> of
certified lunatic—you are not likely to
make so good a friend as I have.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He shut the door noiselessly and was gone.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron stood in the middle of the floor for fully
five minutes, looking blankly at the closed door; then
with a sigh he turned out the light and tumbled into bed
again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dover express was nearing town: evening had
begun to draw in, and from the wayside houses
people saw the train roar by like a huge glowworm;
but they could hardly guess that it was
hurrying two real actors to the climax of a real comedy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the opposite sides of a first-class carriage these
two looked cheerfully at one another. The Channel
was safely behind them, London was close ahead, and
the piston of the engine seemed to thump a triumphal air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We’ve done it, Twiddel, my boy!”</span> said the one.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank Heaven!”</span> replied the other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And</span></span> myself,”</span> added his friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said Twiddel; <span class="tei tei-q">“you played your part uncommonly
well, Welsh.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It was the deuce of a fine spree!”</span> sighed Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The deuce,”</span> assented Twiddel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m only sorry it’s all over,”</span> Welsh went on, gazing
regretfully up at the lamp of the carriage. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’d give the
remains of my character and my chance of a public funeral
to be starting again from Paris by the morning train!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel laughed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With the same head you had that morning?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, by George! Even with the same mile of dusty
gullet!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s all over now,”</span> said Twiddel, philosophically,
and yet rather nervously—<span class="tei tei-q">“at least the amusing part
of it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“All the fun, my boy, all the fun. All the dinners
and the drinks, and the touching of hats to the aristocratic
travellers, and the girls that sighed, and the bowing and
scraping. Do you remember the sporting baronet who
knew my uncle? Now, I’m plain Robert Welsh, whose
uncles, as far as I am aware, don’t know a baronet among
’em.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He smiled a little sardonically.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And the baron at Fogelschloss,”</span> said Twiddel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who insisted on learning my pedigree back to Alfred
the Great! Gad, I gave it him, though, and I doubt
whether the real Essington could have done as much.
I’d rather surprise some of these noblemen if I turned up
again in my true character!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank the Lord, we’re not likely to meet them again!”</span>
exclaimed the doctor, devoutly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Welsh; <span class="tei tei-q">“here endeth the second lesson.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His friend, who had been well brought up, looked a
trifle uncomfortable at this quotation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I say,”</span> he remarked a few minutes later, <span class="tei tei-q">“we haven’t
finished yet. We’ve got to get the man out again, and
hand him back to his friends.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Cured,”</span> said Welsh, with a laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder how he is?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We’ll soon see.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They fell silent again, while the train hurried nearer
and nearer London town. Welsh seemed to be musing
on some nice point, it might be of conscience, it might
also conceivably be of a more practical texture. At last
he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There’s just one thing, old man. What about
the fee?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll get a cheque for it, I suppose,”</span> his friend replied,
with an almost excessive air of mastery over the problem.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha!”</span> laughed Welsh; <span class="tei tei-q">“you know what I mean.
It’s a delicate question and all that, but, hang it, it’s got
to be answered.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What has?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The division of the spoil.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel looked dignified.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll see you get your share, old man,”</span> he answered,
easily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But what share?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You suggested £100, I think.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Out of £500—when I’ve done all the deceiving and
told all the lies! Come, old man!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, what do you want?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you remember a certain crisis when we’d made
a slip&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You’d made a slip!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We</span></span> had made a slip,
and you wanted to chuck the
game and bolt? Do you remember also the terms I
proposed when I offered to beard the local god almighty
in his lair and explain it all away, and how he became
our bosom pal and we were saved?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“£300 to me,
<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E5" id="E5" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e5" class="tei tei-ref">£</a></span>200
to you,”</span> said Welsh, decisively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Rot, old man. I’ll share fairly, if you insist. £250
apiece, will that do?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh said nothing, but his face was no longer the
countenance of the jovial adventurer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It will have to, I suppose,”</span> he replied, at length.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was with this little cloud on the horizon that they
saw the lights of London twinkle through the windows,
and were carried into the clamour of the platforms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They both drove first to Twiddel’s rooms; and as they
looked out once more on the life and lights and traffic of
the streets, their faces cleared again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We’ll have a merry evening!”</span> cried Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A little supper,”</span> suggested Twiddel; <span class="tei tei-q">“a music-hall&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Et cetera,”</span> added Welsh, with a laugh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor had written of their coming, and they
found a fire in the back room, and the table laid.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah,”</span> cried Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“this looks devilish comfortable.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A letter for me,”</span> said Twiddel; <span class="tei tei-q">“from Billson, I
think.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He read it and threw it to his friend, remarking, <span class="tei tei-q">“I call
this rather cool of him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh read—</p>

<div class="block tei tei-q">

  Sorry for leaving your practice, but I think it can

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You have only had two patients, and one

  I fancy, but the story will keep.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Boned a bill?”</span> exclaimed Welsh. <span class="tei tei-q">“What bill, I
wonder?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Something that came when I was away, I suppose.
Hang it, I think Billson might have looked after things
better!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It sounds queer,”</span> said Welsh, reflectively; <span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder
what it was?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Confound Billson, he might have told me,”</span> observed
the doctor. <span class="tei tei-q">“But, I say, you know we have something
more practical to see to.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Getting the man out again?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, let’s have a little grub first.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel rang the bell, and the frowsy little maid entered,
carrying a letter on a tray.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dinner,”</span> said he.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Please, sir,”</span> began the maid, holding out the tray,
<span class="tei tei-q">“this come for you near a month agow, but Missis she bin
and forgot to send it hafter you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Confound her!”</span> said Twiddel, taking the letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked at the envelope, and remarked with a little
start of nervous excitement, <span class="tei tei-q">“From Dr Congleton.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“News of Mr Beveridge,”</span> laughed Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctor read the first few lines, and then, as if he had
got an electric shock, the letter fell from his hand, and an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expression of the most utter and lively consternation came
over his face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Heavens!”</span> he ejaculated, <span class="tei tei-q">“it’s all up.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What’s up?”</span> cried Welsh, snatching at the letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He’s run away!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh looked at him for a moment in some astonishment,
and then burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What a joke!”</span> he cried; <span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t see anything to make
a fuss about. We’re jolly well rid of him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The fee! I won’t get a penny till I bring him back.
And the whole thing will be found out!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the full meaning of this predicament burst upon
Welsh, his face underwent a change by no means pleasant
to watch. For a full minute he swore, and then an ominous
silence fell upon the room.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twiddel was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see the letter,”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“I haven’t
finished it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh read it aloud—</p>

<div class="block tei tei-q">
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dear
  Twiddel</span></span>,—I regret to inform you that the
  patient, Francis Beveridge, whom you placed under my
  care, has escaped from Clankwood. We have made every
  inquiry consistent with strict privacy, but unfortunately
  have not yet been able to lay our hands upon him. We
  only know that he left Ashditch Junction in the London
  express, and was seen walking out of St Euston’s Cross.
  How he has been able to maintain himself in concealment
  without money or clothes, I am unable to imagine.</span></p>
  
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As no inquiries have been made for him
  by his cousin Mr Welsh, or any other of his friends or relatives,
  I am writing to you that you may inform them, and I hope that
  this letter may follow you abroad without delay. I may
  <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
  add that the circumstances of his escape showed most unusual
  cunning, and could not possibly have been guarded against.</span></p>
  
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Trusting that you are having a pleasant
  holiday, I am, yours very truly,</span></p>
  
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: right"><span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: right"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Adolphus S. Congleton</span></span>.”</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two looked at one another in silence for a minute,
and then Welsh said, fiercely, <span class="tei tei-q">“You must catch him again,
Twiddel. Do you think I am going to have all my risk
and trouble for nothing?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>
must catch him! Do you suppose <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span>
let him loose?<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E6" id="E6" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e6" class="tei tei-ref">”</a></span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must catch him, all the same.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shan’t bother my head about him,”</span> answered Twiddel,
with the recklessness of despair.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You won’t? You want to have the story known, I
suppose?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t care if it is.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh looked at him for a minute: then he jumped up
and exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“You need a drink, old man. Let’s hurry
up that slavey.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the first course their countenances cleared a little,
with the second they were almost composed, by the end of
dinner they had started plot-hatching hopefully again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s any odds on the man’s still being in town,”</span> said
Welsh. <span class="tei tei-q">“He had no money or clothes, and evidently he
hasn’t gone to any of his friends, or the whole story would
have been out. Now, there is nowhere where a man can
lie low so well, especially if he is hard up, as London. I
can answer from experience. He is hardly likely to be in
the West End, or the best class of suburbs, so we’ve something
to go upon at once. We must go to a private inquiry
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
office and put men on his track, and then we must
take the town in beats ourselves. So much is clear; do
you see?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And hadn’t we better find out whether anything more
is known at Clankwood?”</span> suggested Twiddel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dr
Congleton wrote a month ago; perhaps they have caught
him by this time.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hardly likely, I’m afraid; he’d have written to you if
they had. Still, we can but ask.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But, I say!”</span> the doctor suddenly exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“people
may find out that I’m back without him.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh was equal to the emergency.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You must leave again at once,”</span> he said decisively,
rising from the table; <span class="tei tei-q">“and there’s no good wasting time,
either.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you mean?”</span> asked the bewildered doctor,
who had not yet assimilated the criminal point of view.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We’ll put our luggage straight on to a cab, drive off to
other rooms—I know a cheap place that will do—and if
by any chance inquiries are made, people must be told
that you are still abroad. Nobody must hear of your coming
home to-night.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is it&mdash;&mdash;”</span> began Twiddel, dubiously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is it what?”</span> snapped his friend.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is it worth it?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is £500, not to speak of two reputations, worth it!
Come on!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unfortunate doctor sighed, and rose too. He was
beginning to think that the nefarious acquisition of fees
might have drawbacks after all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chronicle must now go back a few days and follow
another up-express.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I must either be a clergyman or a policeman,”</span> Mr
Bunker reflected, in the corner of his carriage; <span class="tei tei-q">“they seem
to me to be on the whole the two least molested professions.
Each certainly has a livery which, if its occupier is
ordinarily judicious, ought to serve as a certificate of
sanity. To me all policemen are precisely alike, but I
daresay they know them apart in the force, and as all the
beats and crossings are presumably taken already, I
might excite suspicion by my mere superfluity. Besides,
a theatrical costumier’s uniform would possibly lack some
ridiculous but essential detail.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He lit another cigar and looked humorously out of the
window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall take orders. An amateur theatrical clergyman’s
costume will be more comfortable, and probably
less erroneous. They allow them some latitude, I believe;
and I don’t suppose there are any visible ordination
scars whose absence would give me away. I shall certainly
study the first reverend brother I meet to see.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus wisely ruminating, he arrived in London at a very
early hour on a chilly morning, and drove straight to a
small hotel near King’s Cross, where the landlord was
much gratified at receiving so respectable a guest as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Rev. Alexander Butler. (<span class="tei tei-q">“I must begin with a B.”</span> said
Mr Bunker to himself; <span class="tei tei-q">“I think it’s lucky.”</span>)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true the reverend gentleman was in evening clothes,
while his hat and coat had a singularly secular, not to say
fashionable, appearance; but, as he mentioned casually
in the course of some extremely affable remarks, he had
been dining in a country house, and had not thought it
worth while changing before he left. After breakfasting
he dressed himself in an equally secular suit of tweeds
and went out, he mentioned incidentally, to call at his
tailor’s for his professional habit, which he seemed surprised
to learn had not yet been forwarded to the hotel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A visit to a certain well-known firm of theatrical costumiers
was followed by his reappearance in a cab accompanied
by a bulky brown paper parcel; and presently he
emerged from his room attired more consistently with his
office, much to his own satisfaction, for, as he observed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot say I approve of clergymen masquerading as
laymen.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His opinion on the converse circumstance was not expressed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much to his landlord’s disappointment, he informed
him that he should probably leave again that afternoon,
and then he went out for a walk.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About half an hour later he was once more in the street
where, not so very long ago, a very exciting cab-race had
finished. He strolled slowly past Dr Twiddel’s house.
The blinds of the front room were down; at that hour
there was no sign of life about it, and he saw nothing at
all to arrest his attention. Then he looked down the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other side of the street, and to his great satisfaction spied
a card, with the legend <span class="tei tei-q">“Apartments to let,”</span> in one of the
first-floor windows of a house immediately opposite.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rang the bell, and in a moment a rotund and loquacious
landlady appeared. Yes, the drawing-room was to
let; would the reverend gentleman come up and see it?
Mr Bunker went up, and approved. They readily
agreed upon terms, and the landlady, charmed with her
new lodger’s appearance and manners, no less than with
the respectability of his profession, proceeded to descant
at some length on the quiet, comfort, and numerous other
advantages of the apartments.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Just the very plice you wants, sir. We ’ave ’ad
clerical gentlemen ’ere before, sir; in fact, there’s
one a-staying ’ere now, second floor,—you may know of
’im, sir,—the Reverend Mr John Duggs; a very pleasant
gentleman you’ll find him, sir. I’ll tell ’im
you’re ’ere, sir; ’e’d be
sure to like to meet another gentleman of the syme cloth,
has they say.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somehow or other the Rev. Mr Butler failed to display
the hearty pleasure at this announcement that the worthy
Mrs Gabbon had naturally expected.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aloud he merely said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed,”</span> politely, but with no
unusual interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within himself he reflected, <span class="tei tei-q">“The deuce take Mr John
Duggs! However, I want the rooms, and a man must risk
something.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a precautionary measure he visited a second-hand
bookseller on his way back, and purchased a small assortment
of the severest-looking works on theology they kept
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in stock; and these, with his slender luggage, he brought
round to Mrs Gabbon’s in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked carefully out of his sitting-room window,
but the doctor’s blinds were still down, and he saw no one
coming or going about the house; so he began his inquiries
by calling up his landlady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I have been troubled with lumbago, Mrs Gabbon,”</span> he
began.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dearie me, sir,”</span> said Mrs Gabbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“I’m sorry to ’ear
that; you that looks so ’ealthy too! Well, one never
knows what’s be’ind a ’appy hexterior, does one, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, Mrs Gabbon,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, solemnly;
<span class="tei tei-q">“one never knows what even a clergyman’s coat conceals.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That’s very true, sir. In the midst of life we are
in&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Lumbago,”</span> interposed Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Gabbon looked a trifle startled.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> he continued with the same gravity, <span class="tei tei-q">“I may
unfortunately have occasion to consult a doctor&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“There’s Dr Smith,”</span> interrupted Mrs Gabbon, her
equanimity quite restored by his ecclesiastical tone and
the mention of ailments; <span class="tei tei-q">“’e attended my poor dear
’usband hall through his last illness; an huncommon clever
doctor, sir, as I ought to know, sir, bein’&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No doubt an excellent man, Mrs Gabbon; but I should
like to know of one as near at hand as possible. Now I
see the name of a Dr Twiddel&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I wouldn’t recommend ’im, sir,”</span> said Mrs Gabbon,
pursing her mouth.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span class="tei tei-add"><a name="E7" id="E7" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e7" class="tei tei-ref">“</a></span>Indeed? Why not?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“’E attended Mrs Brown’s servant-girl,
sir,—she bein’
the lady as has the ’ouse next door,—and what he
give <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">’er</span></span>
didn’t do no good. Mrs Brown tell me ’erself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Still, in an emergency&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Besides which, he ain’t at ’ome, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where has he gone?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Abroad, they do say, sir; though I don’t rightly know
much about ’im.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Has he been away long?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Gabbon considered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It must ’ave bin before the middle of November he
went, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> exclaimed Mr Bunker, keenly, though apparently
more to himself than his landlady.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The middle of November, you say? That’s a long
holiday for a doctor to take.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“’E ’avn’t no practice to speak
of,—not as I knows of, leastways.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What sort of a man is he—young or old?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“By my opinion, sir, ’e’s too young. I
don’t ’old by
them young doctors. Now Dr Smith, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dr Twiddel is quite a young man, then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What I’d call little better than a boy, sir. They tell
me they lets ’em loose very young nowadays.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“About twenty-five, say?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“’E might be that, sir; but I don’t know much about
’im, sir. Now Dr Smith, sir, ’e’s different.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact at this point Mrs Gabbon showed such a tendency
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to turn the conversation back to the merits of Dr
Smith and the precise nature of Mr Bunker’s ailment,
that her lodger, in despair, requested her to bring up a cup
of tea as speedily as possible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Before the middle of November,”</span> he said to himself.
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is certainly a curious coincidence.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To a gentleman of Mr Bunker’s sociable habits and
active mind, the prospect of sitting day by day in the company
of his theological treatises and talkative landlady,
and watching an apparently uninhabited house, seemed
at first sight even less entertaining than a return to
Clankwood. But, as he said of himself, he possessed
a kind of easy workaday philosophy, and, besides that, an
apparently irresistible attraction for the incidents of
life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had barely finished his cup of tea, and was sitting
over the fire smoking one of the Baron’s cigars and looking
through one of the few books he had brought that bore no
relation to divinity, his feet high upon the side of the
mantelpiece, his ready-made costume perhaps a little
more unbuttoned than the strictest propriety might approve,
and a stiff glass of whisky-and-water at his elbow,
when there came a rap at his door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In response to his <span class="tei tei-q">“Come in,”</span> a middle-aged gentleman,
dressed in clerical attire, entered. He had a broad,
bearded face, a dull eye, and an indescribably average
aspect.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The devil! Mr John Duggs himself,”</span> thought Mr
Bunker, hastily adopting a more conventional attitude
and feeling for his button-holes.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah—er—Mr Butler, I believe?”</span> said the stranger,
with an apologetic air.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The same,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, smiling affably.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I,”</span> continued his visitor, advancing with more confidence,
<span class="tei tei-q">“am Mr Duggs. I am dwelling at present in the
apartment immediately above you, and hearing of the
arrival of a fellow-clergyman, through my worthy friend
Mrs Gabbon, I have taken the liberty of calling. She
gave me to understand that you were not undesirous of
making my acquaintance, Mr Butler.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The deuce, she did!”</span> thought Mr Butler. Aloud he
answered most politely, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am honoured, Mr Duggs.
Won’t you sit down?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First casting a wary eye upon a chair, Mr Duggs seated
himself carefully on the edge of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It is quite evident,”</span> thought Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he has
spotted something wrong. I believe a bobby would have
been safer after all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He assumed the longest face he could draw, and remarked
sententiously, <span class="tei tei-q">“The weather has been unpleasantly
cold of late, Mr Duggs.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He flattered himself that his guest seemed instantly
more at his ease. Certainly he replied with as much
cordiality as a man with such a dull eye could be supposed
to display.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It has, Mr Butler; in fact I have suffered from a chill
for some weeks. Ahem!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have something to drink,”</span> suggested Mr Bunker,
sympathetically. <span class="tei tei-q">“I’m trying a little whisky myself, as a
cure for cold.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I—ah—I am sorry. I do not touch spirits.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I, on the contrary, am glad to hear it. Too few of our
clergymen nowadays support the cause of temperance by
example.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker felt a little natural pride in this happily
expressed sentiment, but his visitor merely turned his cold
eye on the whisky bottle, and breathed heavily.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Confound him!”</span> he thought; <span class="tei tei-q">“I’ll give him something
to snort at if he is going to conduct himself like this.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have a cigar?”</span> he asked aloud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Duggs seemed to regard the cigar-box a little less
unkindly than the whisky bottle; but after a careful look
at it he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid they seem a little too strong
for me. I am a light smoker, Mr Butler.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Really,”</span> smiled Mr Bunker; <span class="tei tei-q">“so many virtues in one
room reminds me of the virgins of Gomorrah.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon? The what?”</span> asked Mr Duggs,
with a startled stare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker suspected that he had made a slip in his
biblical reminiscences, but he continued to smile imperturbably,
and inquired with a perfect air of surprise,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Haven’t you read the novel I referred to?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Duggs appeared a little relieved, but he answered
blankly enough, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—ah—have not. What is the book
you refer to?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, don’t you know? To tell the truth, I forget the
title. It’s by a somewhat well-known lady writer of
religious fiction. A Miss—her name escapes me at this
moment.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact, as Mr Bunker had no idea how long his friend
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might be dwelling in the apartment immediately above
him, he thought it more prudent to make no statement
that could possibly be checked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am no great admirer of religious fiction of any kind,”</span>
replied Mr Duggs, <span class="tei tei-q">“particularly that written by emotional
females.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said Mr Bunker, pleasantly; <span class="tei tei-q">“I should imagine
your own doctrines were not apt to err on the sentimental
side.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am not aware that I have said anything to you about
my—doctrines, as you call them, Mr Butler.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Still, don’t you think one can generally tell a man’s
creed from his coat, and his sympathies from the way he
cocks his hat?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I think,”</span> replied Mr Duggs, <span class="tei tei-q">“that our ideas of our
vocation are somewhat different.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mine is, I admit,”</span> said Mr Bunker, who had come to
the conclusion that the strain of playing his part was really
too great, and was now being happily carried along by his
tongue.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Duggs for a moment was evidently disposed to give
battle, but thinking better of it, he contented himself with
frowning at his younger opponent, and abruptly changed
the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I ask what position you hold in the church, Mr
Butler?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> began Mr Bunker, lightly: it was on the tip of
his tongue to say <span class="tei tei-q">“a clergyman, of course,”</span> when he suddenly
recollected that he might be anything from the rank
of curate up to the people who wear gaiters (and who these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were precisely he didn’t know). An ingenious solution
suggested itself. He replied with a preliminary inquiry,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have you ever been in the East, Mr Duggs?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I regret to say I have not hitherto had the opportunity.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thank the Lord for that,”</span> thought Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have been a missionary,”</span> he said quietly, and looked
dreamily into the fire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a happy move. Mr Duggs was visibly impressed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah?”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed? I am much interested to
learn this, Mr Butler. It—ah—gives me perhaps a somewhat
different view of your—ah—opinions. Where did
your work lie?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“China,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, thinking it best to keep as
far abroad as possible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> exclaimed Mr Duggs. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is really extremely
fortunate. I am at present, Mr Butler, studying the
religions and customs of China at the British Museum,
with a view to going out there myself very shortly. I
already feel I know almost as much about that most interesting
country as if I had lived there. I should like to
talk with you at some length on the subject.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker saw that it was time to put an end to this
conversation, at whatever minor risk of perturbing his
visitor. He had been a little alarmed, too, by noticing
that Mr Duggs’ dull eye had wandered frequently to his
theological library, which with his usual foresight he had
strewn conspicuously on the table, and that any expression
it had was rather of suspicious curiosity than gratification.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I should like to hear some of your experiences,”</span> Mr
Duggs continued. <span class="tei tei-q">“In what province did you work?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In Hung Hang Ho,”</span> replied Mr Bunker. His visitor
looked puzzled, but he continued boldly, <span class="tei tei-q">“My experiences
were somewhat unpleasant. I became engaged to a
mandarin’s daughter—a charming girl. I was suspected,
however, of abetting an illicit traffic in Chinese lanterns.
My companions were manicured alive, and I only made
my escape in a pagoda, or a junk—I was in too much of a
hurry to notice which—at the imminent peril of my life.
Don’t go to China, Mr Duggs.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Duggs rose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Young man,”</span> he said, sternly, <span class="tei tei-q">“put away that fatal
bottle. I can only suppose that it is under the influence of
drink that you have ventured to tell me such an irreverent
and impossible story.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> began Mr Bunker, warmly,—for he thought that
an outburst of indignation would probably be the safest
way of concluding the interview,—when he stopped abruptly
and listened. All the time his ears had been alive
to anything going on outside, and now he heard a cab
rattle up and stop close by. It might be at Dr Twiddel’s,
he thought, and, turning from his visitor, he sprang to the
window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Remarking distantly, <span class="tei tei-q">“I hear a cab; it is possibly a
friend I am expecting,”</span> Mr Duggs stepped to the other
window.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was only, however, a hansom at the door of the next
house, out of which a very golden-haired young lady was
stepping.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Aha,”</span> said Mr Bunker, quite forgetting the indignant
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> he had begun to play;
<span class="tei tei-q">“rather nice! Is this your friend, Mr Duggs?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Duggs gave him one look of his dull eyes, and
walked straight for the door. As he went out he merely
remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our acquaintance has been brief, Mr Butler,
but it has been quite sufficient.”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That was Mr Bunker’s first and last meeting with the
Rev. John Duggs, and he took no small credit to himself
for having so effectually incensed his neighbour, without,
at the same time, bringing suspicion on anything more
pertinent than his sobriety.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet sometimes in the course of the next three days
he would have been thankful to see him again, if only to
have another passage-of-arms. The time passed most
wearily; the consulting-room blinds were never raised; no
cabs stopped before the doctor’s door; nobody except the
little servant ever moved about the house.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He could think of no plan better than waiting; and so he
waited, showing himself seldom in the streets, and even
sitting behind the curtain while he watched at the window.
After writing at some length to the Baron he had no
further correspondence that he could distract himself
with; he was even forced once or twice to dip into the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
theological works. Mrs Gabbon had evidently <span class="tei tei-q">“’eard
sommat”</span> from Mr Duggs, and treated him to little of her
society. The boredom became so excessive that he decided
he must make a move soon, however rash it was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only active step he took, and indeed the only step
he saw his way to take, was a call on Dr Twiddel’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">locum</span></span>.
But luck seemed to run dead against him. Dr Billson
had departed <span class="tei tei-q">“on his holiday,”</span> he was informed, and
would not return for three weeks. So Mr Bunker was
driven back to his window and the Baron’s cigars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the evening of his fourth day in Mrs Gabbon’s
rooms. He had finished a modest dinner and was dealing
himself hands at piquet with an old pack of cards, when
he heard the rattle of a cab coming up the street. The
usual faint flicker of hope rose: the cab stopped below
him, the flicker burned brighter, and in an instant he was
at the window. He opened the slats of the blind, and the
flicker was aflame. Before the doctor’s house a four-wheeled
cab was standing laden with luggage, and two
men were going up the steps. He watched the luggage
being taken in and the cab drive away, and then he turned
radiantly back to the fire.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The curtain is up,”</span> he said to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“What’s the
first act to be?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently he put on his
<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E8" id="E8" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e8" class="tei tei-ref">wide-awake</a></span>
hat and went out for
a stroll. He walked slowly past the doctor’s house, but
there was nothing to be seen or heard. Remembering the
room at the back, he was not surprised to find no chink of
light about the front windows, and thinking it better not
to run the risk of being seen lingering there, he walked on.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He was in such good spirits, and had been cooped up so
continually for the last few days, that he went on and on,
and it was not till about a couple of hours had passed that
he approached his rooms again. As he came down the
street he was surprised to see by the light of a lamp that
another four-wheeler was standing before the doctor’s
house, also laden with luggage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two men jumped in, one after another, and when he
had come at his fastest walk within twenty yards or so,
the cabman whipped up and drove rapidly away, luggage
and men and all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked up and down for a hansom, but there were
none to be seen. For a few yards he set off at a run in
pursuit, and then, finding that the horse was being driven
at a great rate, and remembering the paucity of stray cabs
in the quiet streets and roads round about, he stopped and
considered the question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“After all,”</span> he reflected, <span class="tei tei-q">“it may not have been Dr
Twiddel who drove away; in fact, if it was he who arrived
in the first cab, it’s any odds against it. Pooh! It can’t
be. Still, it’s a curious thing if two cabs loaded with
luggage came to the house in the same evening, and one
drove away without unlading.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With his spirits a little damped in spite of his philosophy,
he went back to his rooms.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the morning the consulting-room blinds were still
down, and the house looked as deserted as ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He waited till lunch, and then he went out boldly and
pulled the doctor’s bell. The same little maid appeared,
but she evidently did not recognise the fashionable patient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who disappeared so mysteriously in the demure-looking
clergyman at the door.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Is Dr Twiddel at home?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir, he ain’t back yet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He hasn’t been back?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker looked at her keenly, and then said to himself,
<span class="tei tei-q">“She is lying.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He thought he would try a chance shot.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But he was expected home last night, I believe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maid looked a little staggered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He ain’t been,”</span> she replied.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I happen to have heard that he called here,”</span> he hazarded
again.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This time she was evidently put about.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He ain’t been here—as I knows of.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He slipped half-a-crown into her hand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Think again,”</span> he said, in his most winning accents.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor little maid was obviously in a dilemma.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Do you want him particular, sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Particularly.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She fidgeted a little.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He told me,”</span> he pursued, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he might look in at
his rooms last night. He left no message for me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What
<span class="tei tei-corr"><a name="E9" id="E9" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a href="#e9" class="tei tei-ref">name</a></span>,
sir?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr Butler.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Then, my dear,”</span> said Mr Bunker, with his most insinuating
smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was here for a little, you can’t
deny?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the maid’s embarrassed glance down his long coat,
he suddenly realised that there was perhaps a distinction
between lay and clerical smiles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He might have just looked in, sir,”</span> she admitted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But he didn’t want it known?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Quite right, I advised him not to, and you did very well
not to tell me at first.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He smiled approvingly and made a pretence of turning
away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, by the way,”</span> he added, stopping as if struck by an
after-thought, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is he still in town? He promised to leave
word for me, but he has evidently forgotten.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I don’t know, sir; ’e didn’t say.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What? He left <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></span> word at all?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker held out another half-crown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s truth, sir,”</span> said the maid, drawing back; <span class="tei tei-q">“we
don’t know where ’e is.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Take it, all the same; you have been very discreet.
You have no idea?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maid hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></span> ’ear Mr
Welsh say something about lookin’ for
rooms,”</span> she allowed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In London?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I expect so, sir; but ’e didn’t say no more.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mr Welsh is the friend who came with him, of course?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks,”</span> said Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“By the way, Dr Twiddel
might not like your telling this even to a friend, so you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
needn’t say I called, I’ll tell him myself when I see him,
and I won’t give you away.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He smiled benignly, and the little maid thanked him
quite gratefully.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Evidently,”</span> he thought as he went away, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
meant for something in the detective line.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He returned to his rooms to meditate, and the longer
he thought the more puzzled he became, and yet the
more convinced that he had taken up a thread that must
lead him somewhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As for my plan of action,”</span> he considered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see nothing
better for it than staying where I am—and watching.
This mysterious doctor must surely steal back some night.
Now and then I might go round the town and try a cast in
the likeliest bars—oh, hang me, though! I forgot I was a
clergyman.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That night he had a welcome distraction in the shape of
a letter from the Baron. It was written from Brierley
Park, in the Baron’s best pointed German hand, and it ran
thus—</p>

<div class="block tei tei-q">
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">My
  dear Bunker</span></span>,—I was greatly more delighted
  than I am able to express to you from the amusing correspondence
  you addressed me. How glad I am, I can
  assure you, that you are still in safety and comfort. Remember,
  my dear friend, to call for me when need arises,
  although I do think you can guard yourself as well as
  most alone.</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This leaves me happy and healthful, and
  in utmost prosperity with the kind Sir Richard and his charming

  <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“They have talked of you here. I laugh
  and keep my tongue when they wonder who he is and whither gone

  enjoy the joke, they say, and especially do the ladies,
  (You humbug, Bunker!) <span class="tei tei-q">‘How charming was the imitation,
  Baron!’</span> You can indeed win the hearts, if wishful
  so. The Lady Grillyer and her unexpressable daughter
  I have often seen. To-day they come here for two nights.
  I did suggest it to Lady Brierley, and I fear she did suspect
  the condition of my heart; but she charmingly smiled,
  she asked them, and they come!</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Countess, I fear, does not now love

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr Twiddel, meanwhile, was no less anxious to make
the Rev. Alexander Butler’s acquaintance than the Rev.
Alexander Butler was to make his. Not that he was
aware of that gentleman’s recent change of identity and
occupation; but most industrious endeavors to find a certain
Mr Beveridge were made in the course of the next few
days. He and Welsh were living modestly and obscurely
in the neighbourhood of the Pentonville Road, scouring
the town by day, studying a map and laying the most
ingenious plans at night. Welsh’s first effort, as soon as
they were established in their new quarters, was to induce
his friend to go down to Clankwood and make further
inquiries, but this Twiddel absolutely declined to do.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear chap,”</span> he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“supposing anything
were found out, or even suspected, what am I to say?
Old Congleton knows me well, and for his own sake doesn’t
want to make a fuss; but if he really spots that something
is wrong, he will be so afraid of his reputation that he’d
give me away like a shot.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“How are you going to give things away by going down
and seeing him?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If</span></span> they have guessed
anything, I’ll give it away. I
haven’t your cheek, you know, and tact, and that sort of
thing; you’d much better go yourself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I?</span></span> It isn’t my business.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You seem to be making it yours. Besides, Dr Congleton
thinks it is. You passed yourself off as the chap’s
cousin, and it is quite natural for you to go and inquire.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh pondered the point. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hang it,”</span> he said at last,
<span class="tei tei-q">“it would do just as well to write. Perhaps it’s safer
after all.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you write.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Why should I, rather than you?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Because you’re his cousin.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh considered again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I don’t suppose it
matters much. I’ll write, if you’re afraid.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was these amiable little touches in his friend’s conversation
that helped to make Twiddel’s lot at this time
so pleasant. In fact, the doctor was learning a good deal
about human nature in cloudy weather.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With great care Welsh composed a polite note of anxious
inquiry, and by return of post received the following
reply:—</p>

<div class="block tei tei-q">
  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">My
  dear Sir</span></span>,—I regret to inform you that we have
  not so far recovered your cousin Mr Beveridge. In all
  probability, however, this cannot be long delayed now, as
  he was seen within the last week at a country house in
  Dampshire, and is known to have fled to London immediately
  on his recognition, but before he could be
  secured. He was then clean shaved, and had been passing
  under the name of Francis Bunker. We are making
  strict inquiries for him in London.</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Nobody can regret the unfortunate
  circumstance of his escape more than I, and, in justice to
  myself and my institution, I can assure you that it was only
  through the most unforeseen and remarkable ingenuity on your
  cousin’s part that it occurred.</span></p>
  <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Trusting that I may soon be able to
  inform you of his recovery, I am, yours very truly,</span></p>

  <p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: right">“<span class="tei tei-hi" style="text-align: right"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Adolphus S. Congleton</span></span>.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their ardour was, if possible, increased by Dr Congleton’s
letter. Mr Beveridge was almost certainly in London,
and they knew now that they must look for a clean-shaved
man. Two private inquiry detectives were at
work; and on their own account they had mapped the
likeliest parts of London into beats, visiting every bar and
restaurant in turn, and occasionally hanging about stations
and the stopping-places for ’buses.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was dreadfully hard work, and after four days of it,
even Welsh began to get a little sickened.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Hang it,”</span> he said in the evening, <span class="tei tei-q">“I haven’t had a
decent dinner since we came back. Mr Bunker can go to
the devil for to-night, I’m going to dine decently. I’m
sick of going round pubs, and not even stopping to have a
drink.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“So am I,”</span> replied Twiddel, cordially; <span class="tei tei-q">“where shall
we go?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The Café Maccarroni,”</span> suggested Welsh; <span class="tei tei-q">“we can’t
afford a West-end place, and they give one a very decent
dinner there.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Café Maccarroni in Holborn is nominally of
foreign extraction,—certainly the waiters and the stout
proprietor come from sunnier lands,—and many of the
diners you can hear talking in strange tongues, with quick
gesticulations. But for the most part they are respectable
citizens of London, who drink Chianti because it stimulates
cheaply and not unpleasantly. The white-painted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
room is bright and clean and seldom very crowded, the
British palate can be tickled with tolerable joints and
cutlets, and the foreign with gravy-covered odds and ends.
Altogether, it may be recommended to such as desire to
dine comfortably and not too conspicuously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hour at which the two friends entered was later
than most of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">habitués</span></span>
dine, and they had the room
almost to themselves. They faced each other across a
small table beside the wall, and very soon the discomforts
of their researches began to seem more tolerable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We’ll catch him soon, old man,”</span> said Welsh, smiling
more affably than he had smiled since they came back.
<span class="tei tei-q">“A day or two more of this kind of work and even London
won’t be able to conceal him any longer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Dash it, we must,”</span> replied Twiddel, bravely. <span class="tei tei-q">“We’ll
show old Congleton how to look for a lunatic.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha!”</span> laughed Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think he’ll be rather relieved
himself. Waiter! another bottle of the same.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bottle arrived, and the waiter was just filling their
glasses when a young clergyman entered the room and
walked quietly towards the farther end. Welsh raised
his glass and exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here’s luck to ourselves, Twiddel,
old man!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that moment the clergyman was passing their table,
and at the mention of this toast he started almost imperceptibly,
and then, throwing a quick glance at the two,
stopped and took a seat at the next table, with his back
turned towards them. Welsh, who was at the farther
side, looked at him with some annoyance, and made a
sign to Twiddel to talk a little more quietly.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the waiter, who came with the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">menu</span></span>, the clergyman
explained in a quiet voice that he was waiting for a friend,
and asked for an evening paper instead, in which he soon
appeared to be deeply engrossed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first the conversation went on in a lower tone, but in
a few minutes they insensibly forgot their neighbour, and
the voices rose again by starts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear fellow,”</span> Welsh was saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“we can discuss
that afterwards; we haven’t caught him yet.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I want to settle it now.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I thought it was settled.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, it wasn’t,”</span> said Twiddel, with a foreign and
vinous doggedness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you suggest then?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Divide it equally—£250 each.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You think you can claim half the credit for the idea
and half the trouble?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I can claim <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span> the
risk—practically.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Pooh!”</span> said Welsh. <span class="tei tei-q">“You think I risked nothing?
Come, come, let’s talk of something else.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, rot!”</span> interrupted Twiddel, who by this time was
decidedly flushed. <span class="tei tei-q">“You needn’t ride the high horse like
that, you are not Mr Mandell-Essington any longer.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a violent start, the clergyman brought his fist
crash on the table, and exclaimed aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“By Heaven,
that’s it!”</span></p>

</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As one may suppose, everybody in the room started in
great astonishment at this extraordinary outburst. With
a sharp <span class="tei tei-q">“Hollo!”</span> Twiddel turned in his seat, to see the
clergyman standing over him with a look of the keenest
inquiry in his well-favoured face.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“May I ask, Dr Twiddel, what you know of the gentleman
you just named?”</span> he said, with perfect politeness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conscience-smitten doctor gazed at him blankly,
and the colour suddenly left his face. But Welsh’s
nerves were stronger; and, as he looked hard at the
stranger, a jubilant light leaped to his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“It’s our man!”</span> he cried, before his friend could gather
his wits. <span class="tei tei-q">“It’s Beveridge, or Bunker, or whatever he
calls himself! Waiter!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly three waiters, all agog, hurried at his summons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker regarded him with considerable surprise.
He had quite expected that the pair would be thrown into
confusion, but not that it would take this form.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Excuse me, sir,”</span> he began, but Welsh interrupted him
by crying to the leading waiter—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Fetch a four-wheeled cab and a policeman, quick!”</span>
As the man hesitated, he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“This man here is an
escaped lunatic.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The waiter was starting for the door, when Mr Bunker
stepped out quickly and interrupted him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Stop one minute, waiter,”</span> he said, with a quiet, unruffled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
air that went far to establish his sanity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do I
look like a lunatic? Kindly call the proprietor first.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stout proprietor was already on his way to their
table, and the one or two other diners were beginning to
gather round. Mr Bunker’s manner had impressed
even Welsh, and after his nature he took refuge in bluster.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I say, my man,”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“this won’t pass. Somebody
fetch a cab.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Vat is dees about?”</span> asked the proprietor, coming up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your wine, I’m afraid, has been rather too powerful
for this gentleman,”</span> Mr Bunker explained, with a smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Look here,”</span> blustered Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you know you’ve
got a lunatic in the room?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You can perhaps guess it,”</span> smiled Mr Bunker, indicating
Welsh with his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The waiters began to twitter, and Welsh, with an effort,
pulled himself together.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My friend here,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is Dr Twiddel, a well-known
practitioner in London. He can tell you that he
certified this man as a lunatic, and that he afterwards
escaped from his asylum. That is so, Twiddel?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> assented Twiddel, whose colour was beginning
to come back a little.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Who are you, sare?”</span> asked the proprietor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Show him your card, Twiddel,”</span> said Welsh, producing
his own and handing it over.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proprietor looked at both cards, and then turned to
Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And who are you, sare?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My name is Mandell-Essington.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His name&mdash;&mdash;”</span> began Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Have you a card?”</span> interposed the proprietor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am sorry I have not,”</span> replied Mr Bunker (to still
call him by the name of his choice).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His name is Francis Beveridge,”</span> said Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon; it is Mandell-Essington.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Any other description?”</span> Welsh asked, with a sneer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“A gentleman, I believe.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No other occupation?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Not unless you can call a justice of the peace such,”</span>
replied Mr Bunker, with a smile.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And yet he disguises himself as a clergyman!”</span> exclaimed
Welsh, triumphantly, turning to the proprietor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker saw that he was caught, but he merely
laughed, and observed, <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend here disguises himself
in liquor, a much less respectable cloak.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately the humour of this remark was somewhat
thrown away on his present audience; indeed, coming
from a professed clergyman, it produced an unfavourable
impression.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are not a clergyman?”</span> said the proprietor, suspiciously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am glad to say I am not,”</span> replied Mr Bunker,
frankly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Den vat do you do in dis dress?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I put it on as a compliment to the cloth; I retain it at
present for decency,”</span> said Mr Bunker, whose tongue had
now got a fair start of him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Mad,”</span> remarked Welsh, confidentially, shrugging his
shoulders with really excellent dramatic effect.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time the audience were disposed to agree with
him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You can give no better account of yourself dan dis?”</span>
asked the proprietor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am anxious to,”</span> replied Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“but a public
restaurant is not the place in which I choose to give it.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Fetch the cab and the policeman,”</span> said Welsh to a
waiter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment another gentleman entered the room,
and at the sight of him Mr Bunker’s face brightened,
and he stopped the waiter by a cry of, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wait one moment;
here comes a gentleman who knows me.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everybody turned, and beheld a burly, very fashionably
dressed young man, with a fair moustache and a cheerful
countenance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, Bonker!”</span> he cried.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This confirmation of Mr Bunker’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliases</span></span> ought, one
would expect, to have delighted the two conspirators, but,
instead, it produced the most remarkable effect. Twiddel
utterly collapsed, while even Welsh’s impudence at
last deserted him. Neither said a word as the Baron von
Blitzenberg greeted his friend with affectionate heartiness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, zis is good for ze heart! Bot, how? vat
makes it here?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, the most unfortunate mistake has
occurred. Two men here&mdash;&mdash;”</span> But at this moment he
stopped in great surprise, for the Baron was staring hard
first at Welsh and then at Twiddel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> he exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr Mandell-Essington, I zink?”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh hesitated for an instant, and his hesitation was
evident to all. Then he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, you are mistaken.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Surely I cannot be; you did stay in Fogelschloss?”</span>
said the Baron. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not zis Dr Twiddel?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No—er—ah—yes,”</span> stammered Twiddel, looking feebly
at Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron looked from the one to the other in great
perplexity, when Mr Bunker, who had been much puzzled
by this conversation, broke in, <span class="tei tei-q">“Did you call that person
Mandell-Essington?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I cairtainly zought it vas.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Where did you meet him?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In Bavaria, at my own castle.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are mistaken, sir,”</span> said Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One moment, Mr Welsh,”</span> said Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“How
long ago was this, Baron?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Jost before I gom to London. He travelled viz zis
ozzer gentleman, Dr Twiddel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You are wrong, sir,”</span> persisted Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“For his health,”</span> added the Baron.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A light began to dawn on Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“His health?”</span> he cried, and then smiled politely at
Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“We will talk this over, Mr Welsh.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am sorry I happen to be going,”</span> said Welsh, taking
his hat and coat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What, without your lunatic?”</span> asked Mr Bunker.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“That is Dr Twiddel’s affair, not mine. Kindly let me
pass, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, Mr Welsh; if you go now, it will be in the company
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of that policeman you were so anxious to send for.”</span>
There was such an unmistakable threat in Mr Bunker’s
voice and eye that Welsh hesitated. <span class="tei tei-q">“We will talk it over,
Mr Welsh,”</span> Mr Bunker repeated distinctly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Kindly sit
down. I have several things to ask you and your friend
Dr Twiddel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Muttering something under his breath, Welsh hung up
his coat and hat, sat down, and then assuming an air of
great impudence, remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire away, Mr
Mandell-Essington—Beveridge—Bunker,
or whatever you call yourself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without paying the slightest attention to this piece of
humour, Mr Bunker turned to the bewildered proprietor,
and, to the intense disappointment of the audience, said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“You can leave us now, thank you; our talk is likely to be
of a somewhat private nature.”</span> As their gallery withdrew,
he drew up a chair for the Baron, and all four sat
round the small table.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said Mr Bunker to Welsh, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will perhaps
be kind enough to give me a precise account of your
doings since the middle of November.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’m d&mdash;&mdash;d if I do,”</span> replied Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Sare,”</span> interposed the Baron in his stateliest manner,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I know not now who you may be, but I see you are no
gentleman. Ven you are viz gentlemen—and noblemen—you
vill please to speak respectfully.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stare that Welsh attempted in reply was somewhat
ineffective.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps, Dr Twiddel, you can give the account I
want?”</span> said Mr Bunker.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor doctor looked at his friend, hesitated, and
finally stammered out, <span class="tei tei-q">“I—I don’t see why.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker pulled a paper out of his pocket and showed
it to him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps this may suggest a why.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the doctor saw the bill for Mr Beveridge’s linen,
the last of his courage ebbed away. He glanced helplessly
at Welsh, but his ally was now leaning back in his
chair with such an irritating assumption of indifference,
and the prospective fee had so obviously vanished, that
he was suddenly seized with the most virtuous resolutions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“What do you want to know, sir?”</span> he asked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“In the first place, how did you come to have anything
to do with me?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh, whose sharp wits instantly divined the weak
point in the attack, cut in quickly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don’t tell him if he
doesn’t know already!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Twiddel’s relapse to virtue was complete. <span class="tei tei-q">“I was
asked to take charge of you while&mdash;&mdash;”</span> He hesitated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“While I was unwell,”</span> smiled Mr Bunker. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I was to travel with you.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But I—I didn’t like the idea, you see; and so—in
fact—Welsh suggested that I should take him instead.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“While you locked me up in Clankwood?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha, ha!”</span> laughed Mr Bunker, <span class="tei tei-q">“I must say it was
a devilish humorous idea.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this Twiddel began to take heart again.</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I am very sorry, sir, for&mdash;&mdash;”</span> he began, when the
Baron interrupted excitedly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Zen vat is your name, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> am Mr
Mandell-Essington, Baron.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron looked at the other two in turn with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he turned indignantly upon Welsh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You were impostor zen, sare? You gom to my house
and call yourself a gentleman, and impose upon me, and
tell of your family and your estates. You, a low—er—er—vat
you say?—a low <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cad!</span></span>
Bonker, I cannot sit at ze same table viz zese persons!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rose as he spoke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“One moment, Baron! Before we send these gentlemen
back to their really promising career of fraud, I want
to ask one or two more questions.”</span> He turned to Twiddel.
<span class="tei tei-q">“What were you to be paid for this?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“£500.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr Bunker opened his eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“That’s the way my
money goes? From your anxiety to recapture me, I
presume you have not yet been paid?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, I assure you, Mr Essington,”</span> said Twiddel,
eagerly; <span class="tei tei-q">“I give you my word.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I shall judge by the circumstances rather than your
word, sir. It is perhaps unnecessary to inform you that
you have had your trouble for nothing.”</span> He looked at
them both as though they were curious animals, and
then continued: <span class="tei tei-q">“You, Mr Welsh, are a really wonderfully
typical rascal. I am glad to have met you. You
can now put on your coat and go.”</span> As Welsh still sat
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
defiantly, he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">At
once</span></span>, sir! or you may possibly
find policemen and four-wheeled cabs outside. I have
something else to say to Dr Twiddel.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the best air he could muster, Welsh silently cocked
his hat on the side of his head, threw his coat over his arm,
and was walking out, when a watchful waiter intercepted
him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Your bill, sare.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My friend is paying.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“No, Mr Welsh,”</span> cried the real Essington; <span class="tei tei-q">“I think
you had better pay for this dinner yourself.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Welsh saw the vigilant proprietor already coming towards
him, and with a look that augured ill for Twiddel
when they were alone, he put his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ha, ha!”</span> laughed Essington, <span class="tei tei-q">“the inevitable bill!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> he continued, turning to Twiddel, <span class="tei tei-q">“you,
doctor, seem to me a most unfortunately constructed
biped; your nose is just long enough to enable you to be
led into a singularly original adventure, and your brains
just too few to carry it through creditably. Hang me if I
wouldn’t have made a better job of the business! But
before you disappear from the company of gentlemen I
must ask you to do one favour for me. First thing to-morrow
morning you will go down to Clankwood, tell
what lie you please, and obtain my legal discharge, or
whatever it’s called. After that you may go to the devil—or,
what comes much to the same thing, to Mr Welsh—for
all I care. You will do this without fail?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ye—es,”</span> stammered Twiddel, <span class="tei tei-q">“certainly, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“You may now retire—and the faster the better.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the crestfallen doctor followed his ally out of the
restaurant, the Baron exclaimed in disgust, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ze cads!
You are too merciful. You should punish.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“My dear Baron, after all I am obliged to these rascals
for the most amusing time I have ever had in my life, and
one of the best friends I’ve ever made.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ach, Bonker! Bot vat do I say? You are not Bonker
no more, and yet may I call you so, jost for ze sake of
pleasant times? It vill be too hard to change.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“I’d rather you would, Baron. It will be a perpetual
in memoriam record of my departed virtues.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Departed, Bonker?”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Departed, Baron,”</span> his friend repeated with a sigh;
<span class="tei tei-q">“for how can I ever hope to have so spacious a field for
them again? Believe me, they will wither in an atmosphere
of orthodoxy. And now let us order dinner.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“But first,”</span> said the Baron, blushing, <span class="tei tei-q">“I haf a piece of
news.”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Baron, I guess it!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Ze Lady Alicia is now mine! Congratulate!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“With all my heart, Baron! What could be a fitter
finish than the detection of villainy, the marriage of all
the sane people, and the apotheosis of the lunatic?”</span></p>

            obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the

            of life.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals and
            ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
            generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a

            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright

            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
