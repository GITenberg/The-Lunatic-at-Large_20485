description: Brace yourself for a barrage of belly laughs when you dig into to Lunatic
  at Large by renowned humor writer J. Storer Clouston. Good-natured (and only slightly
  mad) protagonist Francis Beveridge slips unnoticed from the mental institution he
  calls home to treat himself to a good time in London's most luxurious haunts. As
  you might guess, a series of hilarious madcap adventures ensue. A must-read for
  fans of classic comedy.
